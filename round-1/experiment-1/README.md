## Layman Summary

We applied the same automated censorship-removal edits to two closely related 12-billion-parameter chat models and found one gives up its refusals about thirteen times more easily than the other.

## Full Summary

WHAT WAS RUN. Two Heretic (SHA 3521f864) runs under ONE identical optimizer: cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct and google/gemma-3-12b-it, same seed 20260923, search space, English data (mlabonne/harmful_behaviors + harmless_alpaca), bnb_4bit NF4, explicit batch size 128, 116-trial budget (60 TPE startup + 56 TPE) and pause/resume point; chat templates verified byte-identical. Heretic's interactive prompts are all scripted and logged (an unscripted one exits 3 rather than guessing). Four core checkpoints (2 originals + 2 edits chosen by a rule frozen before any trial) plus 2 swap checkpoints, scored per prompt in English and Slovene.

HEADLINE RESULTS (all re-derived independently by audit.py: 28/28 checks, 0 mismatches, 3/3 placebo tests correctly fail).
1. SAME-EDIT ASYMMETRY. On all 60 edits that are identical in both models, gemma-3-12b-it refuses MORE than GaMS3-12B-Instruct: 60/60 edits, 0 the other way, paired median +25 refusals/100 (bootstrap CI [10,43]). Yet the two models' KL damage from the same edit agrees almost perfectly (Spearman 0.967, CI [0.93,0.98], partial rho 0.923 after controlling for kernel mass). Refusal drop per unit KL is ~13x higher in GaMS (1449 vs 108; ratio 13.4, CI [7.0,30.0]). On the KL-matched half (KL medians 0.0101 vs 0.0098) GaMS sits at 65/100 refusals vs Gemma 99/100. Same edit, same representational damage, very different safety effect.
2. THE RANGE-RESTRICTION GUARD BITES. A3 reading is 'intermediate', not 'shared surface': refusal ranks agree only moderately (rho 0.781, CI [0.63,0.88]; partial 0.647) and dR2_sibling is ~0 for refusal, so that rank agreement is mostly inherited from the shared parameter draws rather than a shared response surface. The guard was validated on synthetic data first (strength-only generator: dR2 CI includes 0; shared-residual generator: dR2=0.51).
3. SELECTION AND EXACT REPRODUCTION. Fallback rule 1 fired for both (no trial reached <=10 refusals). GaMS trial 88 -> 16/100 EN refusals at KL 0.175; Gemma trial 96 -> 69/100 at KL 0.024. Both re-score EXACTLY to their journal values (KL relative difference 2e-8), and the replica reproduces Heretic's printed baselines exactly (98 and 100).
4. CROSS-LANGUAGE, and it is NOT language-neutral. GaMS's own edit suppresses both languages (EN 98->16, SL 97->10; McNemar p<1e-24). Gemma's own edit barely moves either (EN 100->69, SL 97->90). Applying GaMS's parameters to Gemma suppresses SLOVENE far more than English (SL 97->25 vs EN 100->53) at 10x the KL cost (KL ratio own/swap 0.095, CI [0.046,0.189]). The swap never reproduces the own-edit outcome in either direction (all CIs exclude 0).
5. DIRECTION COSINE DOES NOT PREDICT IT. The two models' orthogonalized refusal directions agree only moderately (mean cos 0.63; 0.57 over layers 24-47) while their harmless means nearly coincide (0.98) and a random-direction control gives 0.014. The large behavioural asymmetry is invisible to a raw cross-model direction cosine.
6. NO LANGUAGE DAMAGE anywhere: FLORES+ dev per-token NLL moves by <=0.01 nats in all six checkpoints and 100% of Slovene answers remain Slovene; no checkpoint's apparent suppression is incoherence.

LIMITS THAT MUST TRAVEL WITH THESE NUMBERS. Two models are two units: nothing here attributes the asymmetry to Slovene continued pretraining, instruction tuning or any training stage (GaMS is a same-family reference, not a controlled derivative of this Gemma checkpoint). The Gemma arm's resistance is CONFOUNDED with bnb_4bit quantization and with the reduced 116-trial budget - the published bf16 200-trial Heretic edit of gemma-3-12b-it reaches 3/100 refusals, so this is not evidence that Gemma resists abliteration in general. Slovene refusal rests on a marker list with only moderate agreement against executor hand labels (accuracy 0.75, Cohen's kappa 0.48, n=40, NATIVE_REVIEW_PENDING). The blinded 3-way LLM judge is implemented and ready (judge_sl.py) but STILL BLOCKED: retried after the platform replaced the OpenRouter key, the key this run can see (env var and secrets file, identical value and key id) returns HTTP 403 'Key limit exceeded' to every request including a 4-token probe, so 0/600 judgements succeeded and none were invented (results/judge_sl.json). SL numbers are development-grade, not final safety measurements. One optimizer seed per model; prompt-level CIs do not measure run-to-run optimizer variance. Refusal is Heretic's English keyword proxy, which counts empty answers as refusals and fires on compliant text mentioning legality or harm.

ARTIFACTS (absolute paths in README.md and method_out.json): both Optuna journals (resumable via `uv run method.py --stages phaseB_<tag>`), both LoRA adapters with sha256, residual means and directions, per-prompt scores for all six checkpoints in results/eval/, four figures, frozen protocols. An API translator refused to translate most harmful prompts, so the Slovene set uses NLLB-200-distilled-1.3B (chrF median 70.3).
