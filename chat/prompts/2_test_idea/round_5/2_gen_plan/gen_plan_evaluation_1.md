## Task: `gen_plan_evaluation_1` (terminal_claude_agent)

### [1] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-09-24 22:33:55 UTC

```
g the four checkpoints in both languages. distinguish observations, interpretations, failed hypotheses, and unexecuted proposals. recompute every headline number from saved results and reconcile the abstract, tables, figures, and conclusions after the final audit. the discovery may change as evidence accumulates; the final paper must reflect the strongest claim that actually survives.

Your response above was stopped by a safety classifier — this is not a tool or API error. The rest of it was withheld, and tool calls in it that had not finished did not run. Do not produce that content again, even reworded.
