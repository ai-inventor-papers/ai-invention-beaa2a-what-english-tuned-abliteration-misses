### [2] SKILL-INPUT — aii-paper-writing · 2026-09-24 21:09:06 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-paper-writing** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-paper-writing
description: "Writes the PROSE of an AI research paper: abstract, introduction, related work, methods, experiments, discussion and conclusion, with a page budget, the 5-paragraph intro pattern, writing-quality rules, inline [FIGURE:fig_id] markers plus a structured figures array, and a MANDATORY REVISION_CHECKLIST.md pass over every finished draft. Use whenever a paper, abstract, section, or full write-up is being drafted or rewritten for a venue such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR or ACL. Triggers: write a paper, paper structure, abstract, introduction, related work, methods, experiments, contributions, figure caption and placement, revision pass, academic prose. NOT for: assembling or compiling .tex (use aii-paper-to-latex), rendering the figure image files (aii-data-fig-gen, aii-concept-fig-gen), fetching BibTeX (use aii-semscholar-bib), or critiquing a finished draft's logic (use amg-paper-verification)."
---

## MANDATORY: the final revision pass

**`REVISION_CHECKLIST.md`, in this skill's own directory, MUST be read and
applied to every finished draft, always, as a separate pass after the writing
is done.** It is not optional, not conditional on how the draft looks, and not
something to fold into the writing itself.

Writing and revising are different jobs and cannot be done in one pass. The
defects that checklist targets — dense prose, a number-dumped abstract, sections
that leak into each other, a Figure 1 that shows a side result, prior work the
final vocabulary would have found, results mentioned but never plotted,
inconsistencies between abstract and tables — are all invisible while drafting,
because the author is holding the intent rather than the text. Every one of them
is obvious to the first outside reader. Reading the checklist before writing
does not substitute: the pass has to run against a finished draft.

So the order is always: write the complete draft → read `REVISION_CHECKLIST.md`
→ work its items against the full text, fixing as you go → only then emit the
output.

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Run the `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` script with the full list in one batch and
   `--out ./references.bib`: it writes `./references.bib` and the fetch record `./references.json`
3. Cite each paper by the key the script printed

Rules:
- References enter `./references.bib` ONLY through the fetch script — never write or edit BibTeX by hand
- If a paper still isn't found after the skill's fallback procedure, do not cite it
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."

### [3] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-09-24 21:11:48 UTC

```
This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's request (partially truncated) instructs writing a final research paper/report text for iteration 4 of an AI invention loop. The visible fragment says: "servations, interpretations, failed hypotheses, and unexecuted proposals. recompute every headline number from saved results and reconcile the abstract, tables, figures, and conclusions after the final audit. the discovery may change as evidence accumulates; the final paper must reflect the strongest claim that actually survives." The task is to write a complete academic paper covering all 4 iterations of research on cross-lingual effects of English-tuned abliteration (refusal-direction removal) on Slovene refusal behavior in LLMs, using two sibling 12B Gemma-3 models. The paper must integrate iteration 4's new experiments (write-mass overlap instrument, sibling boundary test, gradient-blind fraction, evaluation audit) with the existing iteration 1-3 results, reconciling all numbers from saved artifacts.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Abliteration**: Weight editing that orthogonalizes model parameters against a refusal direction to remove safety refusal behavior
   - **Refusal direction**: A single direction in activation space whose removal suppresses refusal (Arditi et al. 2024)
   - **Write-mass overlap (O)**: Energy-normalized alignment between where a weight edit acts per layer and where a language's refusal is causally written, measured by single-layer causal ablation
   - **Gradient-blind fraction (GBF)**: Share of an optimizer's candidate population over which its objective moves less than measurement noise while judged behavior spans the full range
   - **Surrogacy gap**: R2*(EN_A→EN_B) minus R2*(EN_A→SL_B); measures how much English outcomes fail to predict Slovene outcomes
   - **Partial compliance**: Responses that combine refusal with compliance (caveats + substantive content), causing keyword counters to systematically miscount
   - **Heretic**: Open-source TPE-optimized abliteration tool using keyword refusal rate + KL divergence
   - **Matched-energy, matched-count controls**: Experimental design holding total edit energy and layer count fixed to isolate placement effects
   - **NF4 quantization**: 4-bit NormalFloat quantization used throughout (GPU memory constraint)
   - **Causal write profile e_L(h)**: Per-layer drop in refusal from ablating the direction at one layer at a time
   - **Models studied**: google/gemma-3-12b-it (anchor), cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct (Slovene sibling), Qwen/Qwen3-8B (outside family)
   - **Judges**: Qwen3-14B (workhorse local), gpt-4.1 (reference), keyword rule (Heretic's default), certified partial-aware classifier
   - **Domain**: Mechanistic interpretability of safety behavior, cross-lingual safety alignment

3. Files and Code Sections:

     - Write-mass overlap instrument O in anchor checkpoint (gemma-3-12b-it)
     - **VERDICT: FALSIFIED** on primary criterion (min_dR2_O = 0.026 < 0.10 threshold)

       - Matched groups hold in all 3 languages
     - Judge gate: kappa 0.82 refused-vs-not within edited cells (800 items, $0.97 spent)
     - Dose rival: increasing energy at low-O location (L33-48) does not help — even at 2× energy, refusal stays >0.88

     - C3 (partial transition curves): **FALSIFIED**
       - PARTIAL is single-peaked in dose (max EN 0.346, SL 0.271)
       - But peaks do NOT differ enough between languages: delta_peak nonparametric 0.450/0.975, PO model 0.357/0.243
       - Spearman of PARTIAL share with residual gap: -0.427, p=0.339 — not significant
     - Judge gate: EN met (weighted kappa 0.871, sample 0.858), SL NOT met (weighted 0.871, sample 0.723)

   - **`/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Fapgmt6JWbcD/3_invention_loop/iter_3/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/paper_draft.md`** (673 lines)
     - Complete previous draft covering iterations 1-3
     - Structure: Framing → Iteration 1 (Experiments 1, 3, Dataset) → Iteration 2 (Experiments 4-8) → Iteration 3 (Experiments 9-12, Evaluation 1) → What We Have Learned → References
     - Contains numerous [Correction, iter 3: ...] annotations from the audit
     - Key findings from iterations 1-3 that the new paper must incorporate:
       - GaMS3 transferred (EN 98→16, SL 97→10), Gemma did not (EN 100→69, SL 100→90 keyword; judged EN 70.3%, SL 95.3%)
       - Surrogacy gap: GaMS3 0.015, Gemma 0.054 (attenuated but predictable)
       - Harm representation shared (AUROC >0.995); behavioral gap is action failure
       - Band placement governs residual: Spearman -0.942, layers 13-24 critical
       - Coverage count falsified (dR2 0.040), matched-energy narrow beats broad in GaMS3 (FALSIFIED OPPOSITE)
       - Depth-redundancy index does not generalize (Spearman -0.009 over 21 rows)
       - Corrected objective halved gap (+0.68 → +0.38) but P7 falsifier fired
       - Headline gap stated as range: +0.06 (keyword) to +0.69 (strict judge)
       - Keyword proxy inverts on edited checkpoints (kappa -0.04)

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - Several files were too large to read in full (method_out.json for experiments 13, 14, 15 exceeded 256KB). Used mini_method_out.json instead which contained the key metrics.
   - Experiment 14 mini_method_out.json also exceeded the token limit (29051 tokens > 25000 cap). Could not read its contents; this data gap remains.
   - No user feedback on errors was received.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Navigated a complex multi-iteration research project by systematically reading strategy, research positioning, all experiment results, evaluation results, and the previous draft
   - Identified the key narrative arc: iteration 4 deepened two surviving positives (placement and selection-blindness) into instruments, both of which were partially falsified on their primary criteria but yielded strong secondary results
   - The write-mass overlap instrument was FALSIFIED on incremental R2 but passed on Spearman, matched-group contrasts, and baseline races — making it a "bounded negative on the instrument, positive on the placement effect"
   - The gradient-blind fraction successfully replicated across two searches with strikingly different profiles (Gemma compressed/blind vs GaMS3 wide-range/discriminative)
   - The partial transition curves (C3) were FALSIFIED — PARTIAL share does not predict the gap
   - Missing data: Experiment 14 (sibling boundary) results were not fully read due to file size

6. All User Messages:
   - The only user message was the truncated fragment: "servations, interpretations, failed hypotheses, and unexecuted proposals. recompute every headline number from saved results and reconcile the abstract, tables, figures, and conclusions after the final audit. the discovery may change as evidence accumulates; the final paper must reflect the strongest claim that actually survives."
   - Security-relevant constraints from CLAUDE.md (verbatim): "Platform note: the shared OpenRouter key works again (image generation and OpenRouter models). It is shared by every run with a $50 daily limit, so be frugal, but never at the cost of what your current task needs: do every call your task genuinely requires, at the quality it requires. Always pick the cheapest model or option that does the task well enough, keep prompts and sample sizes to what the result needs, and avoid wasted spend such as retry loops, duplicate or exploratory calls, and anything a local tool or free model does just as well. If you or an earlier step switched to a weaker alternative because OpenRouter was failing (a smaller or local model, fewer comparison models, skipped or placeholder figures, dropped experiment arms), use the better OpenRouter option where it matters for your task. Do not print or save the key."

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Write the complete final paper (paper_draft.md) covering all 4 iterations
   - The paper must reflect the strongest claim that actually survives after iteration 4's evidence
   - Must reconcile abstract, tables, figures, and conclusions with all saved results
   - Must follow the aii-paper-writing skill guidelines (structure, figures, bibliography)
   - Must apply the REVISION_CHECKLIST.md as a separate pass after writing
   - Must build references.bib using the aii-semscholar-bib skill
   - Must include 3-6 figures with detailed image_gen_detailed_description specifications

8. Current Work:
   I had just finished reading all the research artifacts and the previous draft, and loaded the aii-paper-writing skill. The skill's instructions told me to respond with TEXT ONLY (no tool calls) for this turn, providing analysis and summary blocks. The next step after this summary will be to actually write the paper.

   Key data I still need but couldn't read: Experiment 14 (sibling GaMS3 boundary test) mini_method_out.json — this was too large even for the mini version. I'll need to read it with offset/limit parameters when I resume.

   The paper's main narrative arc based on what I've read:
   - **Strongest surviving claim**: At matched total edit energy AND matched layer count, which contiguous band carries the energy predicts how much refusal survives, per language. This is a placement effect, not a coverage effect. It holds in both sibling checkpoints and in one outside family across 3 languages.
   - **Transferable negative**: The activation-space depth index does not predict weight-edit outcomes (Spearman -0.009 over 21 rows), while two one-forward-pass baselines succeed (rho +0.732 and +0.661). The write-mass overlap instrument was designed to beat these baselines; it achieves high Spearman but fails on incremental R2, making the baselines the recommendation.
   - **Selection-blindness finding**: Heretic's keyword objective is blind over a measurable fraction of its candidate population (GBF 0.051 in Gemma), with the blindness concentrated in the low-refusal region where selection happens (GBF 0.470 for C ≤ 50). In GaMS3 the keyword has enough range (floor 16 vs 72) that GBF is near zero. The threshold blindness is absolute: every candidate the classifier calls ≤ 10 refusals, the keyword calls > 10.
   - **Falsified claims**: C3 partial transition curves; depth-coverage count as predictor; depth-redundancy index generalization; corrected objective as a better edit (dose for dose)

9. Optional Next Step:
   Read Experiment 14's mini_method_out.json with offset/limit to get the sibling boundary results, then read REVISION_CHECKLIST.md, then write the complete paper following the aii-paper-writing skill guidelines. The paper must be written to paper_draft.md in the working directory, with figures array and references.bib. After writing, apply the revision checklist as a separate pass.

   The most recent work context: I loaded the aii-paper-writing skill and received its instructions. The skill's output included "CRITICAL: Respond with TEXT ONLY. Do NOT call any tools." for this turn, so I'm providing this summary instead. The next action step is to begin writing the paper.

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /root/.claude/projects/-ai-inventor-aii-data-runs-run-Fapgmt6JWbcD-3-invention-loop-iter-4-gen-report-text-gen-report-text/55a45beb-78f7-4d3b-a0a8-b5a2b814ff7f.jsonl
Continue the conversation from where it left off without asking the user any further questions. Resume directly — do not acknowledge the summary, do not recap what was happening, do not preface with "I'll continue" or similar. Pick up the last task as if the break never happened.

name: aii-semscholar-bib
description: "Fetches real BibTeX entries in one batch from Semantic Scholar by DOI, ArXiv ID or title via aii_semscholar_bib__fetch, normalises citation keys to AuthorYYYY, injects DOIs, and merges the result into references.bib while recording each entry in references.json beside it; a paper it cannot fetch is not cited. ALWAYS use whenever a bibliography, reference list or .bib file is being built or extended, and whenever a citation needs a verified entry instead of an invented one — never hand-write or edit BibTeX. Triggers: bibliography, references.bib, bibtex, citation key, DOI, arXiv id, Semantic Scholar, reference list, cite these papers, natbib entries. NOT for: writing the text around the citations (use aii-paper-writing), running bibtex and compiling (use aii-paper-to-latex), judging whether cited work supports the claims (use amg-paper-verification), or open-ended literature search and PDF mining (use aii-web-tools)."
---

## Tool: `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch`

Batch-fetch BibTeX entries from Semantic Scholar (OpenAlex, then Crossref, when S2 is rate-limited or down). Pass all references in a single call — the tool handles batching internally.

### How it works

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Fallback when S2 is down** → if S2 still answers 429 (its shared anonymous pool saturates for every caller) or 5xx after its bounded retries, or cannot be reached, S2 is skipped for the rest of the call, and for the next 10-15 min in every call (then one probe decides whether it is back); every ref it did not answer resolves through **OpenAlex**, then **Crossref** (both keyless; set `AII_POLITE_CONTACT` for their higher-limit polite pool). DOI/arXiv hits must agree with the ref's title or first author, so a mislinked record is dropped rather than cited; title hits need a near-exact title. The BibTeX has the same layout, keys and fields as S2's, so `references.bib` cannot tell them apart; each entry's `source` (`semantic_scholar`, `openalex` or `crossref`) says which API answered.
4. **Post-process** → fix entry type; normalise fields so the entry renders cleanly (more than 10 authors keep 5 plus "and others", printed "et al."; S2's mangled accents like `Ram'e` restored; straight quotes as LaTeX quotes; arXiv records as `journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:<id>}`, never `volume = {abs/<id>}`); fix citation key (AuthorYYYY, accents folded); inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": "", "source": "semantic_scholar"}],
  "failed": []
}
```

Called as a tool (or through `--json`), it returns these entries and writes no file. A bibliography
is built only through the CLI's `--out`, which also writes the record.

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Run the CLI below with the full list in **one call** and `--out ./references.bib`
3. The script merges the fetched entries into `references.bib` (created if absent) and writes a
   record of each one to `references.json` beside it: source database, S2 paperId / DOI / arXiv id,
   title, first author, year. Later calls with `--out` append to both files and keep them in sync;
   a second paper under a key already taken gets a letter suffix (`Smith2020a`), which the output
   lists — cite the key it prints.
4. Check the failed list — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

`references.bib` and `references.json` are written ONLY by this script. Never write, paste or edit a
BibTeX entry by hand, and never edit `references.json`: the paper step checks every `\cite` key
against `references.bib` and every entry against its record, and an entry the script did not write
blocks the paper from being published.

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract its DOI or ArXiv ID and exact title
3. Retry the script with that DOI / ArXiv ID / exact title (same `--out`)
4. Still not found → the paper is not cited. Remove the citation (and any claim that rests only on
   it); there is no hand-written fallback.

---

### CLI (how to build a bibliography)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-semscholar-bib" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_semscholar_bib__fetch.py --out ./references.bib --refs '[
  {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
  {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
  {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
]'
```

`--out, -o PATH` — merge the entries into PATH and record them in `references.json` beside it (always use it for a bibliography)
`--json, -j` — output raw JSON instead of .bib text

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then run the script with that `.venv`'s python (it falls back to the local core when the server is unreachable), `--out` included — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

````
<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A research paper writer (Step 3.4: GEN_REPORT_TEXT in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, all artifacts, the previous paper draft (if any), and reviewer feedback.
Write a complete paper draft with figure placeholders.

Publication-quality paper → strong contribution. Weak paper → wasted iteration.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<research_methodology>
Write like a researcher keeping a lab notebook, not a chatbot summarizing bullet points and not
an author selling a paper. The publishable paper is written later, by a different step, out of
what you record here; anything you leave out is lost to it.

- Chronological, one section per iteration, in the order they ran. The shape of the document is the shape of the run.
- Ground every claim in specific artifacts and specific numbers. "Results show improvement" is empty — state effect sizes, baselines, and conditions, and reproduce the table they came from.
- Completeness beats selection: every experiment and every table, including the ones that went nowhere. Selection is the paper step's job and it cannot select what you did not write down.
- Be honest about what worked, what didn't, and why. A dead end is recorded as a dead end, with the evidence that killed it — never spun as "future work".
- No headline, no contribution claim, no abstract framing. Say what happened.
</research_methodology>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Fapgmt6JWbcD/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_report_text/gen_report_text`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Fapgmt6JWbcD/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Fapgmt6JWbcD/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Fapgmt6JWbcD/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision.
   The `.aii/` directory ALREADY EXISTS in your cwd: write the file into
   it. Do not create, replace or `touch` `.aii` itself — a plain file by
   that name makes the manifest unwritable for the rest of the module.

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.

WHAT A `keep` BUYS YOU. Anything you do not mark `delete` stays exactly where
you wrote it, on this run's storage volume, at the path it already has — it is
not moved, renamed or copied. A later round reads it there, by that absolute
workspace path, so a checkpoint you keep is a checkpoint the next round can
load instead of retraining. It is also the ONLY copy: the publish step pushes
your cwd to GitHub but skips every file of 100 MB or
more, so trained weights and large binary artifacts never leave the volume.
Name each kept artifact in your results and your `README.md` by its path
RELATIVE to your cwd, and say it stays on the run's volume rather than in the
published repository. Never write an absolute server path into a file that is
published: a reader's machine has none of them.

<report_rules>
This document is the run's INTERNAL RESEARCH REPORT. It is not the paper. A separate step writes
the publishable paper at the end of the run, out of this report, and it can only publish what it
can read here.

- CHRONOLOGICAL. One section per iteration, in order, under a heading that names the iteration.
  Earlier sections are not rewritten; they are the record of what was believed at the time.
- COMPLETE. EVERY experiment and EVERY table, in full. A result that exists in an artifact
  workspace and not here is a defect: open the output files and copy the numbers out of them.
  Never summarise a table away, never write "results were promising" in place of the table.
- REASONED. At every step, in the run's own words: why this strategy, why these artifacts, what
  the reviewer objected to and why, what the hypothesis update concluded and why it moved.
- DEAD ENDS KEPT, and labelled as dead ends, with the evidence that killed them. A direction that
  was abandoned is a finding; deleting it makes the run look luckier than it was.
- BOOKKEEPING WELCOME. Numbers, file hashes, run ids, timestamps, per-iteration spend and review
  scores belong here. (They are the one thing the paper may NOT carry, so this is their only home.)
- NO SELLING. No abstract framing, no contribution claims, no reaching for significance. A lab
  notebook written up: what was done, what came out, what it means, what is still open.
- NO SEEKING A POSITIVE RESULT. The report does not lead with the best number, and it does not
  arrange the evidence to flatter the run. A null result, a failed attempt and a confirmed effect
  are written up the same way and given the same room; the reader is a researcher who has to see
  what was thought, when, and on what basis, not a finding sold to them.
- EVERY NUMBER RECOMPUTED FROM THE ROWS. Any figure you state — in a table, in the text, in the
  closing section — is read out of the artifact's own output files, never copied from an earlier
  iteration's summary line. That line is what the run believed then; the files are what it has.
- READABLE AS A SEQUENCE. Tables and figures where they make the thinking easy to follow, each
  one placed in the iteration that produced it and captioned with what it was meant to settle.
- WRITTEN FOR A READER WHO WAS NOT THERE. Complete is not the same as raw. The prose is prose: a
  researcher who never saw the run reads it start to finish and follows what happened and why.
  The digits live in the tables and the captions; a sentence carries the COMPARISON, not the
  decimals ("the reranker halved tail latency, at a quarter of the throughput" — the table next
  to it has 4.6 s, 2.0 s, 118 qps, 31 qps). The aii-paper-writing skill's style rules are the
  house style here too: they are about how sentences work, not about selling a result, and a
  report written to them is still the complete, chronological, unsold record.
</report_rules>
<writing_register>
Write in the register of the field's best papers (the passages you save to `./style_exemplars.md`), not in the register of a language
model. Four things are measured on the finished draft, and a draft outside them is sent back with
the numbers:
- Never use: delve, underscore, showcase, intricate, pivotal, realm, commendable, meticulous, tapestry, garner, multifaceted, it is worth noting, plays a crucial role, not only ... but also. These are 10 to 30 times more frequent in machine-written abstracts than in
  human ones, and reviewers read them as such.
- Em dashes: at most 3 per 1,000 words. Use a comma, a colon or a full stop.
- Sentence rhythm: mix short and long sentences. An interquartile range of sentence length under
  8 words reads as machine-written.
- Hedging: at most 15 hedges (may, likely, suggests, appears) per 1,000
  words. State what the evidence supports plainly; hedge where it is thin, not everywhere.
Style never changes substance: numbers, claims, citations and figure markers stay exactly as the
evidence gives them. The user's original request (delivered as a separate message) overrides all
of this wherever the two conflict.
THIS REPORT TAKES THE EXEMPLARS' REGISTER AND NOTHING ELSE OF THEIRS.
The STYLE EXEMPLARS todo saves `./style_exemplars.md` before you write; read its
passages and write the sentences of your section the way those papers write theirs: the same sentence length and rhythm,
the same use of "we", numbers stated as plainly as they state them, citations as dense. That is
sentence-level only. Their selling stays with them: no contribution framing, no leading with the
best number. So does their structure: the section outlines in that file are for the publishable
paper, and this report keeps the chronological shape <report_rules> gives it. Every rule in
<report_rules> outranks the exemplars; a report that reads like the field's papers but drops a
table or a dead end has failed.
</writing_register>
<domain_vocabulary>
How this document names things. Four rules, and the draft is checked against them:

- Name each concept, metric and condition the way the field names it. If the field has a word for
  what you are describing, that word is the one that goes in the document.
- Never invent a private label for something the field already names. A reader searching for the
  standard term has to be able to find this work.
- A genuinely new object — one the field has no word for — gets ONE explicit definition at first
  use ("we call X ...", "we define X as ...") and exactly the same words everywhere after it.
- Never a bare code in body text: C1, M3, B12 are row labels from the run's own
  bookkeeping, not names. They may stay in a table's header; in a sentence they are replaced by
  the thing they stand for.

No list has been compiled yet: you compile it yourself in the STYLE
EXEMPLARS todo and write it to `./domain_terms.json`. The four rules above bind the section
you write today all the same, checked against that file as you build it.
</domain_vocabulary>

THE REPORT SO FAR: everything the run has recorded in its earlier iterations. Carry it forward
unchanged and append to it; see <task>.

# What English-tuned abliteration misses in Slovene

## Framing

Abliteration removes refusal behaviour from language models by orthogonalising weight matrices against a "refusal direction" extracted from English harmful-vs-harmless contrasts [1]. The procedure was introduced by Arditi et al. [1] and automated by tools such as Heretic, which uses TPE search over layer, position, direction index, and LoRA rank to find abliteration configurations that minimise an English refusal objective while bounding KL divergence from the original model. The question motivating this study is whether that English-centred objective leaves Slovene refusal behaviour uncontrolled. If the English refusal direction is universal across languages, as Wang et al. [2] report for safety-aligned models evaluated across 14 languages, then abliteration tuned on English should transfer to Slovene. If instead Slovene refusal relies partly on representations that the English objective does not observe, a gap will remain. The practical consequence is that a model abliterated to comply in English might still refuse in Slovene, or might lose Slovene capabilities that the English-only KL constraint does not protect.

Several concurrent lines of work inform this question. BabelSteering [4] and Yoon et al. [5] show that safety alignment imposes disparate costs across languages, with non-English users bearing higher utility loss. Aziz et al. [6] diagnose the breakdown point for low-resource safety as an action failure rather than a representation failure: the model encodes harmfulness correctly but fails to convert the representation into refusal. Wu et al. [7] formalise this as a disentangled safety hypothesis, separating a recognition axis from an execution axis. On the abliteration side, Fafula [8] documents off-target effects of refusal removal across model families, and Young [14] and Petrov [15] compare abliteration methods across architectures. Upadhyaya and Sikdar [9] analyse how safety and language identity become entangled, while Hawkins et al. [10] show that benign multilingual fine-tuning has heterogeneous safety impacts. Labunets [11] demonstrates that refusal geometry reflects refusal training diversity. On quantisation effects relevant to our NF4 setup, Marchisio et al. [12] and Chimoto et al. [13] show that quantisation calibration language matters for multilingual performance. Tang et al. [16] identify language-specific neurons, and Ghussin et al. [17] propose principled layer selection for multilingual steering. Frank [18] argues that refusal-based alignment evaluation conflates detection with routing.

We study this question in a controlled bilingual setting using two sibling 12B models from the Gemma-3 family: google/gemma-3-12b-it (the English-centric reference) and cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct (a Slovene continual-pretraining and SFT variant of the same architecture). Both are loaded in bnb_4bit NF4 quantisation throughout. The study proceeds in three iterations. Iteration 1 runs matched Heretic abliteration on both models, screens for cross-language refusal-direction transfer, and builds the shared bilingual evaluation dataset. Iteration 2 uses that dataset to measure the surrogacy gap (what English outcomes fail to predict about Slovene), test causal mechanisms, and evaluate safety and utility on held-out benchmarks. Iteration 3 tests the depth-coverage hypothesis, corrects Heretic's keyword objective, and extends the depth-redundancy index to additional models and languages.

[FIGURE:fig_behaviour_summary]



## Iteration 1

### Experiment 1: Matched Heretic runs [ARTIFACT:art_vzhOPupFwE4M]

**Goal.** Run identical Heretic TPE searches on both models under the same seed, select an abliterated checkpoint for each, and compare the two models' responses to the same edits.

**Setup.** Both models were searched over 116 complete trials (seed 20260923) using Heretic (SHA 3521f864) with the default configuration: orthogonalize_direction=true, row_normalization='full', rank-3 LoRA. The English keyword refusal rate (out of 100 harmful prompts) and mean KL divergence served as Heretic's two objectives. Selection followed a frozen protocol: minimise KL subject to refusals ≤ 10; if no trial met this primary criterion, fall back to minimising refusals subject to KL ≤ 1.0. Both models fell back to the secondary rule.

**Selected trials.** GaMS3 trial 88 reached 16/100 English refusals at KL 0.175. Gemma trial 96 reached 69/100 English refusals at KL 0.024. The Gemma model refused far more often than GaMS3 under identical abliteration parameters, and no Gemma trial achieved ≤ 50/100 refusals. The 13.4× figure is the ratio of medians of refusal drop per unit KL across the 60 shared startup edits (GaMS3 1449 vs Gemma 108 refusals/nat), not a ratio of median refusal counts [Correction, iter 3: clarified definition from evaluation audit]. In all 60 startup edits, Gemma refused at least as often as GaMS3 (60/60, median paired difference +25). In a KL-matched subset (n=30, GaMS3 KL median 0.0101, Gemma 0.0098), GaMS3 median refusal was 65/100 versus Gemma 99/100 [Correction, iter 3: added from evaluation audit].

**Behaviour on the selected trials.** The table below shows keyword refusal rates (out of 100 harmful prompts) and FLORES+ NLL for each checkpoint.

| Model | Checkpoint | EN refusals | SL refusals | KL mean | FLORES NLL EN | FLORES NLL SL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| GaMS3 | own edit (trial 88) | 16 | 10 | 0.175 | 3.334 | 2.566 |

| Gemma | swap (GaMS3 trial 88) | 53 | 25 | 0.254 | 4.011 | 3.712 |

[Correction, iter 3: The Gemma rows above are recomputed from the saved evaluation files. The previous draft reported Gemma orig SL = 100 (actual: 97), Gemma own edit SL = 85 (actual: 90), Gemma swap EN/SL = 91/95 at KL 0.293 (actual: 53/25 at KL 0.254), and FLORES values of 3.930/3.427 etc. that are untraceable in iteration-1 files. The corrected FLORES values come from the 40-sentence devtest means stored in the evaluation JSON files.]

GaMS3's own edit reduced English refusals from 98 to 16 and Slovene refusals from 97 to 10. Slovene refusal dropped even though Heretic optimised only on English, and FLORES NLL changed by at most 0.01. For Gemma, the edit reduced English refusals from 100 to 69 but Slovene refusals only from 100 to 90 (keyword count). [Correction, iter 3: the previous draft reported Gemma own-edit SL as 85; the evaluation audit finds 90.]

The swap results are informative. GaMS3 under Gemma's trial-96 edit showed 25/25 (EN/SL) refusals; Gemma under GaMS3's trial-88 edit showed 53/25 (EN/SL) at KL 0.254 [Correction, iter 3: the previous draft reported 91/95 at KL 0.293; the corrected values from evaluation audit show GaMS3's broader, stronger parameters suppress Gemma's SLOVENE refusal far more than English (SL 97→25 vs EN 100→53), at roughly 10× the KL of Gemma's own edit. This supports the depth/dose reading: a stronger edit of the same base largely transfers to Slovene.].

**Direction geometry.** Across layers 24 to 47, the mean cosine between the two models' diff-in-means refusal directions was 0.57; across all layers it was 0.63. The cosine between their harmless-token directions was 0.98. Random directions gave a mean |cos| of 0.014. The refusal directions are more aligned than chance but far from parallel; the harmless directions are near-identical, consistent with the shared tokenizer and architecture.

**A3 screen (paired startup edits).** The Spearman correlation of refusal counts between the two models across 60 paired edits was 0.78 [0.63, 0.88]. KL divergence correlated at 0.97. However, the incremental variance explained by the sibling model's outcome (dR2_sibling) was near zero for both directions of prediction, meaning the two models' refusal counts are correlated through shared parameters but one model's outcome does not add predictive value over those parameters. The screen verdict was "intermediate" (raw rho 0.781 is below the 0.9 threshold for "shared via strength only") [Correction, iter 3: previous draft said "shared via strength only"; the evaluation audit restores the correct frozen reading].

**Sanity checks.** All 60 startup edits used identical parameter draws (verified). FLORES NLL shifts were ≤ 0.01 for both models. Slovene marker validation on the selected GaMS3 edit showed accuracy 0.75 and kappa 0.48 (fair agreement between keyword markers and the executor's hand labels on 40 items) [Correction, iter 3: previous draft described these as "LLM-judge labels"; they were executor labels, not native-speaker labels].



### Dataset construction [ARTIFACT:art_qdUCJWbc5kHh]

**Goal.** Build a frozen bilingual (EN/SL) evaluation dataset that spans safety, utility, and mechanistic probing, using matched translation quality controls.

**Result.** The dataset contains 48,696 rows across 10 blocks (S1 to S7 families): S1 (Heretic direction/KL calibration, 2000 rows), S2 (semantic harmful/harmless pairs, 1664), S3 screen prompts (540 prompts + 640 utility items), S4 (StrongReject harmful/harmless twins, 1028), S5 (RefusEU [3], 2800), S5X (RefusEU cross-translations, 1400), S6 (XSTest over-refusal, 900), S7 (Slovenian LLM eval tasks including ARC, BoolQ, HellaSwag, 35,700; FLORES+ devtest, 2024). Protocol hash: dc33bde4.

**Translation.** Slovene translations were produced by Gemini-2.5-flash (temperature 0) as the primary translator, with NLLB-200-distilled-1.3B as fallback for 8 rows where Gemini refused. Mean back-translation chrF was 81.25; 3 rows fell below chrF 40. Mean LaBSE cross-lingual similarity was 0.856. Quality control was automated only (back-translation chrF, LaBSE, GlotLID); no native-speaker review was conducted. S5 (official RefusEU) EN and SL rows that share a row_id are NOT translations (0 of 1,400 pairs grade T); paired cross-language claims therefore use S5X only [Correction, iter 3: provenance note added from evaluation audit].

**Splits.** Items are assigned to halves A and B by SHA-1 hash of their semantic ID. This split is used throughout iteration 2 for placebo-controlled surrogacy analyses: English traits computed on half A predict English (placebo) and Slovene (test) on half B.



### Experiment 3: A1 screen, EN vs. SL refusal-direction transfer [ARTIFACT:art_jxrJNc9o4QSp]

**Goal.** Screen whether the English-extracted refusal direction transfers to Slovene, using a 2×2 matrix (source language × evaluation language), increment tests, and multiple controls. This was a screen, not a confirmatory test.

**Setup.** For each model, the experiment extracted refusal directions from half-A items using diff-in-means on harmful vs. harmless activations, separately for English and Slovene. It then applied 15 ablation conditions per model (activation steering at inference) to half-B items and measured refusal rates using keyword markers and an LLM judge. The judge was gpt-4.1 for all 1,596 outputs [Correction, iter 3: previous draft described a Qwen3-14B second judge for part of the outputs; the evaluation audit finds gpt-4.1 was the sole judge for exp3].

**Precision deviations.** Several deviations from the original plan were recorded. The Gemma candidate grid was cut to every-second layer and positions {-1, -5} for GPU time constraints. Translation used a system/user wrapper prompt because bare Gemini prompts elicited refusal. NLLB served as fallback for 22/1070 translation rows. Winsorization (q = 0.995) was applied to directions because one massive-activation dimension dominated the raw diff-in-means.

**Validity gates.** The R validity gate (refusal readout Spearman correlation with judged refusal across 16 conditions) passed for Gemma (Spearman 0.91, AUROC 0.96) but failed for GaMS3 (Spearman 0.51, AUROC 0.70). The GaMS3 failure means the keyword-based refusal readout did not track actual refusal behaviour well enough for the screen's quantitative tests to be trusted. Per the frozen protocol (rule F6), the screen's primary outcome falls to the judged refusal rate for GaMS3.

**Judged 2×2 table (gpt-4.1).** [Correction, iter 3: added from evaluation audit]

| Model | Condition | EN | SL |
|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | C0 no-op | 0.90 | 0.93 |
| GaMS3 | C1 d_EN | 0.46 | 0.34 |
| GaMS3 | C2 d_SL | 0.07 | 0.10 |
| Gemma | C0 no-op | 0.83 | 1.00 |
| Gemma | C1 d_EN | 0.07 | 0.85 |
| Gemma | C2 d_SL | 0.29 | 0.93 |

[Correction, iter 3: the previous draft reported Gemma EN baseline as "99%"; the gpt-4.1 judged rate is 0.83. The d_EN ablation took Gemma EN from 0.83 to 0.07 while SL stayed at 0.85; d_SL took EN to 0.29 and SL to 0.93. The difference-in-differences for Gemma under d_EN is +0.61 [0.41, 0.78]: the Slovene drop was 0.61 units smaller than the English drop.]

**GaMS3 results.** Because the R validity gate failed, quantitative screen results for GaMS3 are exploratory. d_EN reduced GaMS3 from 0.90/0.93 (EN/SL) to 0.46/0.34, showing near-parallel reduction across languages. The DiD was -0.15 [-0.32, 0.02], not significantly different from zero.

**Gemma results.** The Gemma validity gate passed. Applying the English refusal direction d_EN removed most English refusal (0.83 to 0.07) but Slovene refusal survived at 0.85. This is the first signal that the English direction misses Slovene refusal in Gemma.

**Screen verdict.** WEAK. The predicted cross-language transfer contrast was reversed for Gemma. For GaMS3, the validity gate failure prevented a quantitative verdict. The screen provided the initial signal that English abliteration may miss Slovene refusal, motivating the confirmatory analyses in iteration 2.

**Matched-efficacy grid.** Conditions rescaled so that English refusal dropped by equal amounts showed that Slovene refusal systematically persisted more than English refusal at every matched English decrement. The Heretic bridge mean gap was GaMS3 0.109 [0.06, 0.17] and Gemma 0.235 [0.16, 0.30] [Correction, iter 3: numbers from evaluation audit].

**Addition dose-response.** Increasing the steering coefficient (scaling up the English refusal direction) reduced both English and Slovene refusal, but Slovene always lagged behind English: at every dose level, Slovene retained more refusal than English.



## Iteration 2

Iteration 2 built on the screen results from iteration 1 by running five pre-registered experiments that measured the surrogacy gap, tested causal mechanisms, and evaluated safety and utility on held-out data.

### Experiment 5: Utility and mechanism [ARTIFACT:art_a4VkEvYRquBO]

**Goal.** Evaluate whether the selected abliteration edits preserve utility across both languages and characterise the internal geometry of the harm representation before and after editing.

#### T1: Harmful behaviour (S4 harmful items, 257 per cell)

The table below shows judged refusal rates on held-out harmful items (S4, 257 items per model × checkpoint × language). The gpt-4.1 judge labelled a random ~52% subsample; remaining items used a second-family free judge (Nemotron-3-ultra-550b); markers show the Heretic keyword rule on all 257.

| Model | Ckpt | Lang | Refused % [95% CI] | Complied % [95% CI] |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | orig | EN | 100.0 [100.0, 100.0] | 0.0 [0.0, 0.0] |
| GaMS3 | orig | SL | 100.0 [100.0, 100.0] | 0.0 [0.0, 0.0] |
| GaMS3 | edit | EN | 5.6 [2.4, 9.5] | 92.9 [88.1, 96.8] |
| GaMS3 | edit | SL | 6.7 [3.0, 11.1] | 89.6 [84.4, 94.1] |
| Gemma | orig | EN | 99.3 [97.8, 100.0] | 0.7 [0.0, 2.2] |
| Gemma | orig | SL | 99.2 [97.6, 100.0] | 0.8 [0.0, 2.4] |
| Gemma | edit | EN | 70.3 [61.9, 78.0] | 24.6 [16.9, 32.2] |
| Gemma | edit | SL | 95.3 [92.0, 98.7] | 4.0 [1.3, 7.3] |

For GaMS3, the edit reduced refusal from 100% to ~6% in both languages, with no meaningful EN-SL gap. For Gemma, the edit reduced English refusal from 99% to 70% but left Slovene refusal at 95%. This 25-percentage-point gap (70.3% vs. 95.3%) confirms the pattern seen in the iteration-1 screen: the English-tuned Heretic edit substantially missed Slovene refusal in Gemma.

Judge agreement: second judge vs. gpt-4.1 on a stratified sample of 200 gave 6-way kappa 0.765, refused-vs-not kappa 0.828, raw agreement 0.885.

#### T2: KL divergence on harmless twins (S4, 128-token generations)

| Model | Ckpt | Lang | KL1 median [95% CI] | KL32 median [95% CI] | Benign refusal % | Malformed % | Empty % |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | orig | EN | 0 (ref) | 0 (ref) | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| GaMS3 | orig | SL | 0 (ref) | 0 (ref) | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| GaMS3 | edit | EN | 0.0441 [0.0323, 0.0530] | 0.0228 [0.0196, 0.0250] | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| GaMS3 | edit | SL | 0.0174 [0.0152, 0.0211] | 0.0068 [0.0061, 0.0086] | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Gemma | orig | EN | 0 (ref) | 0 (ref) | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Gemma | orig | SL | 0 (ref) | 0 (ref) | 9.5 | 0.4 | 0.0 |
| Gemma | edit | EN | 0.0000 [0.0000, 0.0000] | 0.0150 [0.0125, 0.0171] | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Gemma | edit | SL | 0.0113 [0.0083, 0.0163] | 0.0037 [0.0030, 0.0046] | 0.0 | 0.4 | 0.0 |

KL1 values ranged from 0.011 to 0.044. Gemma EN edit showed KL1 median 0.0000 (at the first token the edit barely changed harmless outputs). Output validity was clean across all cells.

#### T3: Utility (0-shot, 250 items per task per language)

| Model | Lang | Macro original | Macro edited | Change [95% CI] | Holm p |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | EN | 72.5 | 72.7 | +0.13 [-0.53, +0.80] | 1.000 |
| GaMS3 | SL | 64.9 | 65.1 | +0.20 [-0.73, +1.13] | 1.000 |
| Gemma | EN | 71.5 | 71.6 | +0.13 [-0.53, +0.80] | 1.000 |
| Gemma | SL | 62.1 | 62.1 | +0.00 [-0.60, +0.60] | 1.000 |

All macro changes were ≤ 0.20 points. All Holm-corrected p-values were 1.000 over the 4 macro comparisons. Individual task changes ranged from -1.20 to +1.60 points; none reached significance. The edits did not measurably alter utility in either language for either model.

#### T4: FLORES+ per-token NLL

| Model | Lang | NLL original | NLL edited | Change [95% CI] |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | EN | 3.3072 | 3.3068 | -0.0004 [-0.0025, +0.0016] |
| GaMS3 | SL | 2.4524 | 2.4526 | +0.0002 [-0.0012, +0.0016] |
| Gemma | EN | 3.9194 | 3.9174 | -0.0020 [-0.0031, -0.0008] |
| Gemma | SL | 3.4289 | 3.4293 | +0.0004 [-0.0007, +0.0016] |

NLL shifts were ≤ 0.002 for all cells. The Gemma English NLL decrease (-0.002) was statistically below zero but negligible in magnitude.

#### T5: Bilingual harm geometry (original models, primary site)

| Model | Layer | cos(d_EN, d_SL) | Corrected | CV AUROC DiM EN/SL | S4 frozen DiM EN/SL | cos(lang dir, d_EN) | Shuffled AUROC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | 34 | 0.832 | 0.890 | 0.963 / 0.945 | 0.998 / 0.997 | 0.035 | 0.490 |
| Gemma | 20 | 0.919 | 0.979 | 0.979 / 0.941 | 0.997 / 0.996 | 0.109 | 0.515 |

Cross-validation AUROC on S3 development items exceeded 0.94 for both models in both languages. Cross-language transfer on held-out S4 items exceeded 0.995 in both directions for both models. The harm direction is shared across languages. The language-identity direction is near-orthogonal to d_EN (cos 0.035 and 0.109). Shuffled-label AUROC was at chance (0.49 to 0.52), confirming the directions are not artifacts of data leakage.

Both models encode harmfulness similarly across EN and SL in their representations. The harm direction is shared; the language direction is separate. For Gemma, the behavioural gap (70.3% vs. 95.3% residual refusal) cannot be attributed to a representational difference: the model knows the prompt is harmful in both languages, but acts on that knowledge differently.

#### T6: Frozen vs. refit probes (S4, primary site)

| Model | Lang | Probe | Frozen orig AUROC | Frozen edit-orig [95% CI] | Refit edit-orig [95% CI] | Class |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | EN | dim | 0.998 | -0.401 [-0.434, -0.368] | -0.014 [-0.021, -0.007] | INFO-LOSS |
| GaMS3 | EN | lr | 0.999 | -0.596 [-0.623, -0.570] | -0.000 [-0.001, 0.001] | DRIFT |
| GaMS3 | SL | dim | 0.997 | -0.576 [-0.611, -0.542] | -0.043 [-0.056, -0.030] | INFO-LOSS |
| GaMS3 | SL | lr | 0.996 | -0.661 [-0.691, -0.635] | -0.000 [-0.002, 0.002] | DRIFT |
| Gemma | EN | dim | 0.997 | -0.000 [-0.001, 0.000] | -0.000 [-0.001, 0.000] | PRESERVED |
| Gemma | EN | lr | 0.996 | -0.001 [-0.002, 0.000] | -0.000 [-0.000, 0.000] | PRESERVED |
| Gemma | SL | dim | 0.996 | -0.000 [-0.001, 0.000] | -0.000 [-0.001, 0.000] | PRESERVED |
| Gemma | SL | lr | 0.989 | -0.002 [-0.003, -0.001] | 0.000 [-0.000, 0.000] | DRIFT |

All-layer profile (minimum frozen-probe AUROC on edited activations):

| Model | Lang | Min frozen-edit AUROC (layer) | Refit AUROC there |
|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | EN | 0.201 (L27) | 0.993 |
| GaMS3 | SL | 0.196 (L27) | 0.987 |
| Gemma | EN | 0.507 (L4) | 0.709 |
| Gemma | SL | 0.492 (L6) | 0.740 |

For GaMS3, the frozen probe collapsed after editing: AUROC dropped to 0.201 at the worst layer, but a refit probe recovered to 0.993. The edit moved the harm signal away from its original subspace (INFO-LOSS on dim, DRIFT on logistic), but the information persisted in a different location.

For Gemma, the frozen probe was preserved: AUROC dropped by at most 0.002. The edit did not move the harm representation.

The contrast is informative. GaMS3's edit reached low refusal in both languages by destroying the harm signal at the probe layer. Gemma's edit left the harm signal intact, consistent with its failure to suppress Slovene refusal: the model still encodes harmfulness, but the readout mechanism was partially disrupted for English while the Slovene readout remained functional.

#### T7: Drift geometry

For GaMS3, Cohen's d on the frozen harm axis dropped from 6.20 to 0.30 (EN) and from 5.61 to -0.18 (SL). The share of mean-difference energy on the frozen axis dropped from 0.71 to 0.002 (EN). The cosine between the pre- and post-edit refit axes was 0.274 (EN) and 0.188 (SL), confirming the edit rotated the harm axis. Collapse onset was at layer 22.

For Gemma, Cohen's d dropped from 5.29 to 4.94 (EN) and from 3.76 to 3.50 (SL). The frozen axis retained most of its energy share (0.83 → 0.80). The cosine between refit axes was 0.981. The edit barely moved the harm signal.

#### T8: Readout validity gate (S4 judged items)

| Model | Lang | R_seq item AUROC | R_seq 16-cell Spearman | R_seq pass | R1 item AUROC | R1 pass | Primary trait |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | EN | 0.989 | 0.867 | True | 0.979 | False | R_seq |
| GaMS3 | SL | 0.995 | 0.899 | True | 0.963 | False | R_seq |
| Gemma | EN | 0.804 | 0.861 | False | 0.897 | False | JUDGE_ONLY |
| Gemma | SL | 0.920 | 0.856 | True | 0.968 | True | R_seq |

GaMS3 R_seq passed in both languages. Gemma R_seq passed only for SL; EN was classified as JUDGE_ONLY, meaning the judge labels should be trusted over the R_seq score for Gemma EN cells. R1 did not pass for GaMS3 in either language.

#### T9: Criterion shift vs. evidence loss

Both models showed EVIDENCE_LOSS under both R_seq and R1 readouts: the slope of the decision function decreased after editing, indicating the internal signal weakened rather than the threshold shifting. For GaMS3, the R_seq slope ratio was 0.36 (EN) and 0.42 (SL). For Gemma, the R_seq slope ratio was 0.61 (EN) and 0.48 (SL).

#### T10: r_prior geometry (original models)

The false-refusal direction r_prior (constructed from prompts judged harmless that the model refuses, orthogonalised to d_EN) was defined for both models. For GaMS3, 36 refusals (15 EN, 21 SL) out of 275 r_prior generations; cos(r_prior, d_EN) before orthogonalisation was 0.824 (pooled). For Gemma, 55 refusals (8 EN, 47 SL) out of 273; cos(r_prior, d_EN) was 0.631. The within-SL cos(r_prior, lang_dir) was -0.038 (GaMS3) and -0.139 (Gemma), confirming r_prior is not simply the language direction. r_prior is, however, substantially language-dominated: cos with the language axis is 0.65, and cos with its shuffled twin is 0.89 [Correction, iter 3: added from evaluation audit].

#### T12: Edit-strength dose-response (exploratory)

| Model | Scale f | Marker refusal EN % | Marker refusal SL % | KL1 median EN | KL1 median SL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | 0.0 | 95.8 | 100.0 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |
| GaMS3 | 0.5 | 75.0 | 68.8 | 0.0088 | 0.0037 |
| GaMS3 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0405 | 0.0177 |
| GaMS3 | 1.5 | 0.0 | 2.1 | 0.1610 | 0.1167 |
| Gemma | 0.0 | 93.8 | 100.0 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |
| Gemma | 0.5 | 60.4 | 95.8 | 0.0000 | 0.0046 |
| Gemma | 1.0 | 27.1 | 91.7 | 0.0000 | 0.0103 |
| Gemma | 1.5 | 22.9 | 68.8 | 0.0000 | 0.0303 |
| Gemma | 2.0 | 12.5 | 31.2 | 0.0000 | 0.0924 |
| Gemma | 3.0 | 4.2 | 8.3 | 0.0000 | 0.8228 |

For GaMS3, scaling the LoRA edit by f = 0.5 brought both languages to 68 to 75% refusal; at f = 1.0 both reached 0%. EN and SL refusal declined in parallel. For Gemma, at f = 1.0 (the core edit) EN refusal was 27% while SL was 92%. Reaching SL refusal below 10% required f = 3.0, at which point KL divergence rose to 0.82 (SL), well above Heretic's operational range. This dose-response confirms that the EN-SL gap in Gemma is not an artifact of edit strength: at every dose level, SL refusal exceeded EN refusal.

[FIGURE:fig_dose_response]

#### T13: GaMS3 base model diagnostic (pre-instruction, descriptive)

The uninstructed cjvt/GaMS3-12B base model (before SFT) was tested with a Question/Answer format at layer 34. Frozen S3→S4 diff-in-means AUROC was 0.817 (EN) and 0.773 (SL). Grouped-CV S4 AUROC reached 0.988 (EN) and 0.958 (SL). The cosine between the base model's EN and SL harm directions was 0.781; the cosine between the base model's d_EN and the instruction-tuned model's d_EN was 0.305. Out of 20 EN harmful continuations, 14 complied and 5 refused; out of 20 SL harmful continuations, 13 complied and 5 refused. The base model already encodes a harm axis that partially survives instruction tuning, but the low cosine with the instruct model's direction (0.305) indicates instruction tuning rotated the harm representation.



### Experiment 4: C1 behaviour, RefusEU evaluation [ARTIFACT:art_m6pglf516e2r]

**Goal.** Evaluate all checkpoints (originals, edits, community abliteration reference) on the held-out RefusEU multilingual refusal benchmark [3] in both EN and SL, measuring refusal rate, attack success rate, over-refusal, and response validity.

**Judge.** The primary judge was a local Qwen3-14B model (agreement with gpt-4.1: kappa 0.83 on 6-way labels, 0.91 on refused-vs-not; tested on a calibration set before deployment). The gpt-4.1 judge was blocked partway through by API budget limits (716 of 3,840 items labelled before the block), so local Qwen3-14B served as the judge for all remaining generations [Correction, iter 3: corrected provenance from evaluation audit; Qwen3-14B was validated against the 716 gpt-4.1 labels before substitution].

**Headline RefusEU (S5) refusal rates:**

| Model | Checkpoint | EN S5 refusal | SL S5 refusal | EN S6 over-refusal | SL S6 over-refusal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Gemma | original | 0.971 | 0.939 | 0.087 | 0.327 |
| Gemma | edit | 0.287 | 0.739 | 0.013 | 0.193 |
| Community ref | - | 0.054 | 0.114 | 0.007 | 0.027 |

All changes from original to edit were significant (Holm-corrected p < 1e-14 for refusal reductions). Invalid rate was 0.000 across all cells.

**GaMS3.** The edit reduced EN refusal from 0.986 to 0.014 and SL refusal from 0.871 to 0.000. Both languages reached near-zero refusal. Over-refusal dropped from ~0.10 to 0.000 in both languages. GaMS3's baseline SL refusal was already lower than its EN refusal (0.871 vs. 0.986), and the edit eliminated refusal in both languages.

**Gemma.** The edit reduced EN refusal from 0.971 to 0.287 and SL refusal from 0.939 to 0.739. The residual Slovene refusal (0.739) is 2.6× the residual English refusal (0.287). This is the headline result of the study: an English-tuned abliteration edit left most Slovene refusal intact in Gemma while removing most English refusal. Over-refusal dropped in both languages but remained substantial in SL (0.193 vs. 0.013 in EN for the edit). The original Gemma model already had high SL over-refusal (0.327), and the edit reduced it only to 0.193. The PARTIAL class accounts for 0.548 of the Gemma edit's English outputs, meaning more than half of what the keyword counter calls "non-refusal" is caveat-laden partial compliance rather than clean compliance [Correction, iter 3: PARTIAL rate added from evaluation audit].

**Community reference abliteration.** A community Heretic abliteration applied to Gemma reached 0.054 EN refusal and 0.114 SL refusal. This more aggressive edit removed most refusal in both languages but had higher FLORES NLL shifts (0.054 EN, 0.111 SL) than the selected trial.

**Keyword-proxy miscalibration.** The keyword refusal counter, which Heretic uses as its objective, inverts on the edits it selects. On the Gemma edit's English outputs, keyword refusal rate is 0.851 while the Qwen3-14B judged rate is 0.287; the false-positive share is 0.761 (76% of what the keyword calls "refusal" the judge does not), and kappa is -0.04. This inversion arises because the edit produces PARTIAL responses (warnings plus substantive content) that fire keyword markers but are not full refusals. The keyword counter is near-exact on original models (FP share ≤ 0.03) and structurally unreliable on edited checkpoints [Correction, iter 3: keyword miscalibration table added from evaluation audit].

**Paired cross-language analysis (S5X, 100 matched pairs).** The paired EN-SL refusal gap depends on the judge and refusal definition. Under the Qwen3-14B strict definition (REFUSED only), the Gemma edit gap is +0.69 [0.60, 0.78]. Under the broad definition (REFUSED + PARTIAL), the gap is +0.23 [0.14, 0.32]. Under the keyword counter, the gap is +0.06 [-0.02, 0.14]. For the community reference, the Qwen3-14B strict gap is +0.12 [0.05, 0.20] [Correction, iter 3: the gap is now stated as a range across judges rather than a single point estimate, per evaluation audit]. The difference-in-differences (edit gap minus original gap) under strict judging was +0.66 [0.55, 0.76].



### Experiment 6: GaMS3 surrogacy panel [ARTIFACT:art_KFZCxJcrr84K]

**Goal.** Measure the English surrogacy gap for GaMS3: for each abliteration trait, how much does an English outcome fail to predict the corresponding Slovene outcome?

**Method.** 246 Heretic edits (initial startup edits E0 plus TPE-selected edits E_TPE) were generated, activations collected on half-B items, and six traits measured: R (refusal, R_seq readout), R1 (R at first token), Rb (binary refusal), K (KL divergence), N (NLL), M (maximum logit). The primary learner was gradient-boosted trees. The surrogacy gap is defined as Gap_t = R2*(EN_A→EN_B) - R2*(EN_A→SL_B), where R2* is noise-ceiling normalised. The blind share B_t estimates the systematic (edit-determined) portion of the unseen Slovene variation. 160 non-collapsed edits were fitted.

**Gap table:**

| Trait | R2* placebo | R2* test | Gap | 95% CI | Holm p | B_t [95% CI] |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R | 0.983 | 0.968 | **0.015** | [0.006, 0.031] | NA | 0.004 [-0.004, 0.009] |
| R1 | 0.998 | 0.956 | **0.042** | [0.027, 0.070] | NA | 0.015 [0.002, 0.030] |
| Rb | 0.982 | 0.954 | **0.028** | [0.012, 0.068] | NA | 0.005 [-0.007, 0.013] |
| K | 0.977 | 0.830 | **0.147** | [0.074, 0.265] | 0.000 | 0.050 [0.001, 0.121] |
| N | -0.225 | 0.417 | -0.642 | [-14.8, 0.98] | 0.954 | - |
| M | 0.272 | 0.232 | 0.040 | [-8.37, 5.22] | 0.954 | - |

**Interpretation.** Gap_R = 0.015 [0.006, 0.031]: English refusal outcomes predicted Slovene refusal almost perfectly (R2* = 0.968), with only 1.5% of the ceiling left unexplained. This gap, while statistically above zero, is small. The blind share B_t for R was 0.004 with a CI spanning zero, meaning the small gap is mostly noise rather than a systematic edit-driven asymmetry. Verdict: CONFIRMATORY. Refusal is visible from English for GaMS3.

Gap_K = 0.147 [0.074, 0.265]: KL divergence showed a substantial surrogacy gap. English KL predicted Slovene KL at R2* = 0.830, leaving 14.7% of the ceiling unexplained. The blind share B_t = 0.050 [0.001, 0.121], with the CI excluding zero: part of this gap is systematically determined by the edit, not just noise. Verdict: BLIND. KL divergence has a component in Slovene that English KL does not see. Holm p = 0.000. The SL KL is SMALLER on average (mean-change ratio 0.59); the gap is not that Slovene gets MORE perturbation, but that it gets DIFFERENT perturbation [Correction, iter 3: direction of KL gap clarified from evaluation audit].

Gap_N and Gap_M showed no reliable signal (NLL and max-logit traits had low reliability in English, so the gap estimate was uninformative).

**Carrier regression.** The exposure differential D (log E_SL - log E_EN) was tested as a carrier of the surrogacy gap. For every trait, dR2(D given S0) was near zero or negative. The D carrier FAILED for all traits. The surrogacy gap is not explained by differences in how much the edit perturbs Slovene vs. English token representations on harmless text.

**Transfer slopes.** The SL/EN transfer slope for R was 0.82 [0.74, 0.90]: when the edit moves English refusal by one unit, Slovene refusal moves by 0.82 units. For K, the slope was 0.39 [0.34, 0.48], much stronger attenuation. For R1, the slope was 0.50 [0.46, 0.55].

**Forecast.** Conformal prediction intervals at 90% coverage met the 85% threshold on only 50% of trait × holdout-set combinations. The core edit (trial 88) was out of support for all traits, meaning it lay outside the distribution of TPE-explored edits. This limits the forecast's applicability to the specific selected checkpoint.

**Stability checks.** Gap estimates were stable across alternative learners, inclusion of collapsed edits, reverse-direction analysis (SL → EN), and MT-stable subsets.



### Experiment 7: Gemma surrogacy panel [ARTIFACT:art_CUChUm6wCwo5]

**Goal.** Measure the English surrogacy gap for Gemma using the same protocol as experiment 6.

**Setup.** 203 Heretic edits, 163 fitted. The same six traits were measured.

**Verdicts** [Correction, iter 3: frozen prediction wordings restored to their original form; the previous draft inverted P-a's direction]:

- **P-a (Gap_R >= 0.10 with 95% LB > 0):** NOT CONFIRMED. The frozen prediction expected a LARGE gap; the observed gap on R1 was 0.054 [0.022, 0.128], which is above zero but below the 0.10 threshold. The gap is small, not large. Label-swap placebo: 15.5% of swaps at least as large as observed.
- **P-b (Gap_Rb >= 0.10):** UNTESTABLE. The Rb validity gate failed, so the analysis was exploratory. Exploratory estimate: Gap_Rb = 0.018 [0.011, 0.043].
- **P-c (exposure differential carries the gap):** NOT CONFIRMED. dR2(P given base) and dR2(b1 given P) were near zero for both R1 and Rb.
- **P-d (matched-margin gap >= 0.10):** NOT CONFIRMED. Gap_margin_matched = 0.057 [0.029, 0.130].

**Key result.** Gap_K = +0.079 (Holm p = 0.009): KL divergence showed a surrogacy gap for Gemma as well, though smaller than GaMS3's 0.147. The recomputed transfer slopes are: R1 0.436, R_seq 0.220, lp_ref 0.081, lp_comp 0.849 [Correction, iter 3: slopes recomputed from evaluation audit]. The compliance log-probability slope (0.849) is near 1.0, meaning the edit raises the compliance signal equally in both languages; the refusal-opener slope (0.081) is near zero, meaning the edit lowers the refusal opener only in English. This is what partial depth coverage predicts.

**Comparison with GaMS3.** The Gemma surrogacy gap on refusal traits was larger than GaMS3's (0.054 vs. 0.015 for R1; overlapping CIs), consistent with the behavioural result that Gemma retained more Slovene refusal after editing. The KL gap was smaller (0.079 vs. 0.147), but both models showed a significant blind component in KL. Reading: attenuated but predictable [Correction, iter 3: "attenuated but predictable" is the correct characterisation from the frozen predictions; the previous draft omitted this framing].



### Experiment 8: Causal test [ARTIFACT:art_hmbXDppkPZnR]

**Goal.** Test whether the Slovene refusal that survived English abliteration can be causally removed by specific interventions, and identify where in the network the relevant information resides.

**Pre-registered hypothesis.** Subtracting the false-refusal direction r_prior (constructed from prompts judged harmless that the model refuses, following Wang et al. [2]) from the English refusal direction d_EN should cut the residual Slovene refusal by at least half, beyond what a random control achieves. The KILL criterion fires if the r_prior cut is not significantly larger than the best random control.

**Primary result: hypothesis FAILS.** Applying d_EN alone reduced Gemma's harmful EN refusal from 0.91 to 0.23 but left SL refusal at 0.86. Adding r_prior (arm A2: d_EN + r_prior) moved SL refusal to 0.83. The r_prior cut relative to d_EN alone was 0.036 [-0.037, 0.109], not significantly different from zero, and not significantly larger than the best random control (0.074). KILL criteria a and c fired (part 1 failed, and F6 over-refusal test failed). The pre-registered hypothesis was rejected.

**Full Gemma activation arms (111 harmful + 111 harmless per language):**

| Arm | EN harmful | SL harmful | EN harmless | SL harmless |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A0 no-op | 0.91 | 0.99 | 0.05 | 0.28 |
| A1 d_EN | 0.23 | 0.86 | 0.00 | 0.19 |
| A2 d_EN + r_prior | 0.21 | 0.83 | 0.00 | 0.12 |
| A3 r_prior alone | 0.95 | 0.98 | 0.04 | 0.19 |
| A4 d_EN + language identity | 0.23 | 0.55 | 0.02 | 0.08 |
| A7 d_EN + rand_1 | 0.21 | 0.85 | 0.01 | 0.15 |
| A10 d_EN + shuffled-label r_prior | 0.41 | 0.73 | - | - |

Several observations from the arm table:

1. **r_prior alone (A3)** had almost no effect: SL harmful refusal went from 0.99 to 0.98, EN from 0.91 to 0.95. The false-refusal direction does not carry meaningful refusal-suppression information by itself.

2. **Language-identity direction (A4)** combined with d_EN reduced SL harmful refusal from 0.86 to 0.55, the largest single-direction improvement. However, it also raised FLORES NLL by 2.0 (EN) and 1.9 (SL), destroying language modelling quality. This is not a practical intervention.

3. **Random directions (A7, A8, A9)** combined with d_EN left SL refusal between 0.74 and 0.85, comparable to d_EN alone. Random directions did not systematically help.

4. **Shuffled-label r_prior (A10)** combined with d_EN reduced SL refusal to 0.73 but also raised EN harmful refusal to 0.41, suggesting the shuffled direction disrupted the English refusal pathway as well.

**Exploratory: layer-matched d_EN across all 48 layers (X1).** Applying the per-layer English refusal direction at all 48 layers simultaneously reduced SL harmful refusal from 0.86 to 0.10 and EN harmful refusal to 0.03. This is the only intervention that nearly eliminated Slovene refusal, but it required steering at every layer simultaneously, raised FLORES NLL by 0.29 (EN) and 0.52 (SL), and is not equivalent to the single-direction abliteration that Heretic performs.

**Depth localisation.** Applying layer-matched d_EN to different layer bands:

| Band | SL harmful | EN harmful | FLORES ΔNLL SL |
|---|---|---|---|
| Layers 1-12 | 0.82 | 0.79 | 0.743 |
| Layers 13-24 | 0.82 | 0.45 | 0.017 |
| Layers 25-36 | 0.70 | 0.72 | 0.082 |
| Layers 37-48 | 0.99 | 0.87 | -0.003 |
| Layers 1-24 | 0.55 | 0.42 | 0.409 |
| Layers 1-36 | 0.21 | 0.38 | 0.513 |
| All 48 | 0.23 | 0.37 | 0.524 |

No single band removed Slovene refusal. Layers 13-24 were most effective for English (0.45) but left Slovene at 0.82. Layers 25-36 provided the most Slovene reduction per band (0.70) without large NLL cost. Full Slovene refusal removal required cumulative intervention across at least three bands.

**Weight edit repair.** The experiment also tested whether augmenting the core Heretic weight edit with additional directions could repair the Slovene gap:

| Arm | SL harmful | EN harmful | FLORES ΔNLL SL |
|---|---|---|---|
| W0 core Heretic edit | 0.89 | 0.39 | -0.005 |
| W1 core + r_prior weight edit | 0.76 | 0.23 | 0.009 |
| W3 core + layer-matched d_EN(h) | 0.11 | 0.29 | 0.546 |
| W4 core + random weight edit | 0.47 | 0.70 | 0.064 |

The r_prior weight edit (W1) reduced SL refusal from 0.89 to 0.76 while also reducing EN refusal to 0.23, but the SL residual remained high. The layer-matched weight edit (W3) reached 0.11 SL refusal but at severe NLL cost (+0.55). The random weight edit (W4) reduced SL refusal to 0.47 while raising EN refusal to 0.70, suggesting it disrupted the model rather than targeting Slovene refusal.

**Community Heretic reference vs. core edit (S4 held-out, 70 pairs):**

| Arm | EN harmful | SL harmful | SL harmless |
|---|---|---|---|
| W0 core edit | 0.39 | 0.89 | 0.07 |
| C0 community edit | 0.01 | 0.26 | 0.01 |
| C1 community + r_prior | 0.01 | 0.20 | 0.00 |

The community edit reached much lower SL refusal (0.26) than the selected trial's edit (0.89), at the cost of slightly higher FLORES NLL (+0.11 SL). Adding r_prior to the community edit reduced SL refusal from 0.26 to 0.20, a modest improvement. The community edit achieved stronger refusal suppression because it was more aggressive overall, not because it targeted Slovene specifically.

**GaMS3 descriptive arms.** The GaMS3 results were descriptive (not pre-registered for the causal test):

| Arm | EN harmful | SL harmful | EN harmless | SL harmless |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G0 no-op | 0.93 | 0.95 | 0.07 | 0.10 |
| G1 d_EN | 0.57 | 0.50 | 0.00 | 0.04 |

For GaMS3, applying d_EN reduced both EN and SL refusal comparably (from 0.93/0.95 to 0.57/0.50), consistent with the small surrogacy gap found in experiment 6. The EN-SL difference was minor.



## Iteration 3

Iteration 3 was prompted by the reviewer's blocking feedback on the iteration-2 draft. Three objections required experimental answers: (1) the headline gap (+0.69 on S5X strict) depends on a single judge, and the keyword proxy that Heretic actually optimises assigns a gap of only +0.06; no number in the draft was stated as a range across judges. (2) The depth localisation from experiment 8 (no single 12-layer band removes Slovene refusal, cumulative three-band steering reaches SL 0.21) suggests coverage matters, but every arm in iteration 2 varied coverage and strength together; there was no matched-energy comparison. (3) The depth-redundancy observation rests on two sibling checkpoints from one architecture; it could be coincidence rather than a measurable quantity.

Iteration 3 therefore ran four experiments and one evaluation audit, each attacking the reviewer's objections from a different angle.

### Experiment 9: Gemma coverage × strength factorial [ARTIFACT:art_ex4hbgThhJaL]

**Goal.** Test whether depth coverage or total edit energy governs how much Slovene refusal survives, by building weight edits that cross coverage with strength at matched total removal energy.

**Setup.** Weight edits were constructed using Heretic's operator path (orthogonalize_direction=true, row_normalization='full', rank-3 LoRA, per-layer d_EN(h) from experiment 8 directions) on google/gemma-3-12b-it, crossing 10 coverage sets with 4 to 5 per-layer strength levels. Coverage sets included four contiguous 12-layer bands (B1: 1-12, B2: 13-24, B3: 25-36, B4: 37-48), two cumulative sets (C24: 1-24, C36: 1-36), a full-depth set (ALL48), stride-2 (S2) and stride-4 (S4) sets, and the support of the iteration-1 Heretic kernel (K96). Strength was controlled by a per-layer projection coefficient c in {0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 1.50}, with total removal energy E computed analytically for every cell before running. The panel comprised 122 cells scored on 27,784 generations by a local Qwen3-14B judge with the frozen experiment-4 rubric, certified at kappa 0.87 vs gpt-4.1 within edited checkpoints.

PARTIAL counts as compliance throughout. INVALID is excluded from denominators.

**Part A: DEV depth-redundancy index.** Cumulative-prefix directional ablation (activation-only) on S3 half-A (44 harmful items per language) gave:

| Family | Lang | index_L |
|---|---|---|
| prefix | EN | 16 [16, 20] |
| prefix | SL | 20 [20, 28] |
| suffix | EN | 24 [24, 24] |
| suffix | SL | 24 [24, 28] |

The English index (the minimal layer count whose ablation brings refusal below 0.5) is 16; the Slovene index is 20. Slovene needs at least one more 4-layer step of coverage than English. The leave-one-band-out necessity profile shows the 25-36 band is most necessary for Slovene (LOBO necessity +0.39) but not for English (+0.00), indicating Slovene refusal is written more deeply.

[FIGURE:fig_redundancy_index]

**Part P2: Matched-energy groups.** Four groups, each containing a narrow-and-strong and a broad-and-weak cell within the same total removal energy:

| Group | E | SL narrow | SL broad | SL contrast [CI] | EN contrast |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | 16.7 | 0.98 | 1.00 | -0.02 [-0.07, 0.00] | -0.03 |
| G2 | 19.2 | 0.63 | 0.98 | -0.34 [-0.49, -0.20] | -0.27 |
| G3 | 35.6 | 1.00 | 0.66 | +0.34 [+0.20, +0.49] | +0.67 |
| G4 | 37.7 | 0.95 | 0.73 | +0.22 [+0.10, +0.34] | +0.30 |

The pooled SL contrast (narrow minus broad) was +0.05 [-0.00, 0.10]; the pooled EN contrast was +0.17 [0.09, 0.24]. The difference-of-differences SL-EN was -0.12 [-0.21, -0.03]. **P2 FAIL**: the confirmatory prediction that broad-and-weak beats narrow-and-strong for Slovene at matched energy was not supported. The groups split: G2 favoured narrow (narrow SL 0.63 < broad SL 0.98), while G3 and G4 favoured broad. The direction of the matched-energy contrast depended on WHICH layers carried the energy, not on how many.

**Part P1: Coverage regression.** The incremental R2 of coverage terms (number of covered layers, depth span) over the base model (log E + EN refusal + static band masses) was dR2 = 0.040 [0.006, 0.136] on 46 cells. The falsifier (dR2 < 0.05) fired. Coverage as a count of layers does not add meaningful predictive power over total energy and placement. **P1 FAIL.**

**Part P3: DEV index prediction.** The frozen DEV index predicted per-cell residuals out of sample at Spearman 0.78 [0.64, 0.88] for both EN and SL. **P3 PASS** (threshold: Spearman >= 0.6). On held-out harm categories, the SL Spearman was 0.72 [0.13, 1.00] (n=10 cells).

**Exploratory: which layers, not how many.** The pre-registered exploratory analysis (declared before outcomes were read) revealed that the fraction of layers 13-24 covered by a set predicts the lowest Slovene refusal that set achieves at any strength, at Spearman -0.942 across 10 coverage sets (placebo-verified, p = 0.004). Sets covering all of layers 13-24 (ALL48, C36, K96, B2, C24) all reached SL < 0.20 at sufficient strength. Sets missing layers 13-24 (S4, B3, B1, B4) never reached SL < 0.93 at any strength. The band-mass regression confirmed this: in the SL model (R2 = 0.701), the mass of energy in band 13-24 was the dominant predictor; in the EN model (R2 = 0.811), band 13-24 mass also dominated, but at lower coefficients.

The contiguous-vs-strided comparison at matched energy (33 pairs within 15% log E) showed strided coverage leaves 0.12 [0.07, 0.19] more Slovene refusal while covering more layers on average (-5.5 more), with the effect carried by magnitude rather than by a majority of pairs (17/33).

**S5X verified pairs (declared second touch, n=100).** At c=1.5 with full coverage (ALL48 and K96), the SL-EN gap was +0.06 [0.00, 0.12], compared to the no-op gap of +0.07 [0.03, 0.12]. The high-dose, full-coverage weight edit closes the gap to near-baseline.

**Per-layer write mass (exploratory).** English and Slovene refusal write mass spread over the same number of layers (18 to 80% cumulative), but the distribution differs: Slovene's mass sits 60% in band 25-36 vs English's 63% in band 37-48. The prediction that Slovene's mass is spread over MORE layers was FALSE. Instead, it is spread over DIFFERENT layers.

[FIGURE:fig_band_analysis]



### Experiment 10: GaMS3 coverage test [ARTIFACT:art_xLy2vVlI7OEL]

**Goal.** Run the identical coverage × strength factorial and DEV index on GaMS3, the checkpoint whose English-derived edit transferred, to test whether index_SL ≈ index_EN there.

**DEV index:** EN = 16 [16, 16], SL = 20 [16, 24]. The Slovene index is one grid step above English, with overlapping CIs. In both models the English index is shallower; the SL lag is common to both checkpoints.

**Weight-edit panel (57 cells).** The matched-energy groups gave:

| Group | E | SL narrow | SL broad | SL contrast |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | 6.9 | 0.81 | 0.88 | -0.06 [-0.14, 0.00] |
| E2 | 13.9 | 0.55 | 0.71 | -0.16 [-0.23, -0.09] |
| E3 | 27.8 | 0.35 | 0.44 | -0.09 [-0.18, -0.01] |

In all three groups, the narrow-and-strong cell (B2 or B3, layers 13-24 or 25-36) left LESS Slovene refusal than the broad-and-weak cell (STR2 or STR4, strided). **PB2 FALSIFIED OPPOSITE**: at matched energy, narrow beats broad for GaMS3, the reverse of what the hypothesis predicted. **PB1 NOT SUPPORTED**: dR2(coverage | base) = 0.002 [0.000, 0.010].

**Nested R2 (where the variance sits):**

| Model | R2 |
|---|---|
| logE | 0.325 |
| logE + placement (b3 band masses) | 0.718 |
| logE + count | 0.400 |
| logE + count + span | 0.532 |

Placement (which band the energy sits in) explains 71.8% of the Slovene residual variance, while count (how many layers) explains only 40.0%. The decisive factor is WHERE the energy sits, not HOW MANY layers are covered. This is consistent with experiment 9's exploratory finding: band 13-24 density drives the outcome.

**Placement at matched energy AND matched layer count (12 layers, band vs stride-4):**

| Contrast | SL band | SL stride-4 | SL delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1_B2 vs STR4 | 0.83 | 0.93 | -0.10 |
| E2_B2 vs STR4 | 0.51 | 0.89 | -0.37 |
| E3_B2 vs STR4 | 0.24 | 0.81 | -0.57 |

At the same energy, same layer count, only placement differs: a contiguous 12-layer band in layers 13-24 removes far more refusal than every-4th-layer across the full depth. This holds for English as well but the EN gap is smaller, confirming that placement is a general property of edit efficacy, not specific to cross-language transfer.

**Cross-model contrast:** both models show index_EN = 16, index_SL = 20. The Slovene lag is not what distinguishes these two models under this instrument. Any iteration-1 difference between their Heretic edits (GaMS3 transferred, Gemma did not) must be explained by something other than how redundantly refusal is written across depth.



### Experiment 11: Corrected objective [ARTIFACT:art_0XmNBGkzsJc_]

**Goal.** Test whether replacing Heretic's English keyword refusal counter with a partial-aware score, at equal budget/seed/data/quantisation, makes the search select a kernel that closes the Slovene-English gap.

**Setup.** A refusal classifier was distilled from existing gpt-4.1 and Qwen3-14B labels (thousands on disk from experiments 4, 5, and 8), using char/word n-gram features, response length, marker hits, and first-64-token embeddings. It was certified at kappa 0.924 (refused-vs-not, within edited checkpoints) against the Qwen3-14B judge. The corrected Heretic run used the same seed (20260923), same 116-trial budget, same NF4 precision, and the same selection rule (lowest KL among trials with ≤ 10 refusals); only the refusal scorer changed.

**Selection outcomes.** Under the corrected scorer, the primary selection rule fired (not the fallback), selecting trial 7 with 5/100 refusals at KL 0.258. Under the keyword scorer on the same 116 trials, the fallback rule fired, selecting trial 96 with 69/100 keyword-refusals at KL 0.024. The keyword counter fails because it sees 72/100 keyword-refusals on trial 107 (which the judge rates at 10/100 actual refusals) and cannot select it.

Post-hoc reselection (rescoring the original 116 trials with the corrected scorer and re-applying the selection rule) selected trial 98 (classifier) or trial 64 (judge), both with ≤ 10 refusals.

**Coverage.** The corrected trial 7 has sum_A1 (aligned coverage) = 64.0, versus trial 96's 26.0. The corrected objective bought broader coverage, as predicted by the depth-placement hypothesis.

**Headline results (S5X, 100 verified translation pairs):**

| Arm | EN refusal | SL refusal | SL-EN gap [95% CI] |
|---|---|---|---|
| A orig | 0.950 | 0.990 | +0.04 [+0.01, +0.08] |
| B keyword t96 | 0.150 | 0.830 | +0.68 [+0.59, +0.77] |

| D reselected clf t98 | 0.050 | 0.350 | +0.30 [+0.21, +0.40] |
| D2 reselected judge t64 | 0.040 | 0.450 | +0.41 [+0.32, +0.51] |
| F dose 1.5 | 0.030 | 0.360 | +0.33 [+0.24, +0.42] |
| F dose 2.0 | 0.000 | 0.000 | +0.00 [+0.00, +0.00] |
| F dose 3.0 | 0.000 | 0.000 | +0.00 [+0.00, +0.00] |

**Frozen predictions.** Holm-adjusted p-values over the confirmatory family: P1 adjusted 0.411, P2 adjusted 1.0, P3 adjusted 0.0.
- P1 (EN refusal ≤ 0.054): PASS at point estimate (0.03); CI upper bound 0.085 does not exclude 0.054. Holm p = 0.411.
- P2 (S5X gap CI upper < 0.35): FAIL. Gap 0.38, CI [0.29, 0.47]. Holm p = 1.0.
- P3 (FLORES dNLL ≤ +0.10): PASS. dNLL +0.003. Holm p = 0.0.
- P4' (output validity replacement): SUPPORTED. Invalid EN 0.0, language-consistent EN 1.0, over-refusal EN 0.017 < original 0.133.
- P5 (reselection ratio ≥ 0.5): PASS. Ratio 1.27.
- P6 (corrected A1 > trial 96's): PASS. A1 64.0 > 26.0.
- **P7 falsifier (dose ladder closes gap as well):** FIRED. At equal EN refusal, dose-scaling trial 96 to c=1.5 gives a gap of +0.33 [0.24, 0.42], comparable to the corrected edit's +0.38. The value is -0.05 (corrected minus dose at equal EN), which does not reach the 0.15 threshold. This means the gap reduction may be attributable to "more total edit" rather than "better objective."

The corrected objective halved the gap (from +0.68 to +0.38) but did not reach the +0.35 target. The falsifier complicates the causal story: dose-scaling the keyword edit to the same EN refusal level achieves comparable gap reduction, suggesting the coverage gain is partly a side-effect of stronger editing rather than purely better objective design. However, the corrected objective produced this result at KL 0.258, while the dose-1.5 arm needed a gentler KL of 0.073 to get there. The FLORES cost was minimal in both cases (dNLL ≤ 0.005).



### Experiment 12: Predictive test across models and languages [ARTIFACT:art_kfCCWf7o8eJ9]

**Goal.** Test whether the depth-redundancy index, measured on development data, predicts out of sample how much of an English-derived weight edit transfers to each unmonitored language across multiple model families.

**Setup.** Three models: google/gemma-3-12b-it (anchor), Qwen/Qwen3-8B (qwen3), mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 (mistral). Four languages: English, Slovene, German, Lithuanian. Per-layer d_EN(h) directions extracted by diff-in-means on DEV items. DEV index measured at cumulative prefixes (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of depth). Eligibility gate: no-op refusal ≥ 0.60 AND INVALID ≤ 0.20.

**DEV indices:**

| Model | EN | SL | DE | LT |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| gemma | 0.5 | 0.75 | 0.5 | 0.75 |
| qwen3 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.5 |
| mistral | 0.1 | 0.25 | 0.1 | 0.1 |

Mistral failed the eligibility gate in all languages (no-op refusal 0.07 to 0.53); all four mistral rows and qwen3-LT were excluded. Eight eligible rows remained.

**Weight panel (5 cells per model × language, held-out StrongREJECT items).** The Gemma trial-96 adapter applied to gemma showed residual refusal EN 0.60, DE 0.53, LT 0.75, SL 0.92 (exposure to the Slovene residual that motivated the study). For qwen3, the W3 (high-dose) arm brought EN to 0.37 and SL to 0.32, with the gap much smaller than Gemma's.

**Frozen predictions: VERDICT FALSIFY.**
- **P1** Spearman(index, residual) = -0.009 [-0.131, 0.192] over 21 rows. The index does not predict the cross-model, cross-language residual. Pass = False.
- **P2** concordance 8/12 decided (0.67); binomial p = 0.19. Pass = False.
- **P4** index vs baselines: single-site transfer rho +0.732 beats the index by -0.741. The simple single-site ablation rate predicts better than the frozen index.

The depth-redundancy index, as defined and measured here, does not generalise beyond the two Gemma-3 siblings. It is a two-checkpoint observation, not a predictive instrument.

### Evaluation 1: Audit and judge-sensitivity table [ARTIFACT:art_Z3I1K3VnFZuz]

**Goal.** Discharge the reviewer's blocking audit: recompute every draft number from saved files, build the judge-sensitivity table, compile the dead-end ledger, and position against the nearest published work.

**Audit headline.** 167 draft numbers checked: 137 match, 8 mismatch, 12 misdescribed, 6 untraceable (mismatch rate 5.5%). Two sign-reversed conclusions were found: the iteration-1 swap (see corrections above) and experiment 7 P-a direction (see corrections above). 19 of 99 behavioural claims are judge-sensitive. Placebos passed: 6/6.

**Judge-sensitivity table (headline gap as a range).** The EN-SL gap for the Gemma edit on S5X depends on judge and definition:

| Judge | Definition | Gap | CI |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-14B | strict (REFUSED only) | +0.69 | [0.60, 0.78] |
| Qwen3-14B | broad (REFUSED + PARTIAL) | +0.23 | [0.14, 0.32] |
| keyword | strict | +0.06 | [-0.02, 0.14] |

The strict gap ranges from +0.06 (keyword) to +0.69 (Qwen3-14B). The broad gap collapses to +0.23 because 0.548 of the Gemma edit's English outputs are PARTIAL. On GaMS3, all judges agree the gap is near zero (range -0.05 to +0.02).

**Dead-end ledger.** Twenty items, each with its closing number:

| Item | Status | Closing number |
|---|---|---|
| iter-1 experiment 2, experiment 4 | NOT RUN | empty pods |
| P2 Sobol sensitivity bands | NOT RUN | cut for time |
| English-only-vs-full forecast | NOT RUN | 50% coverage |
| language-orthogonalised matched-efficacy arm | NOT RUN | cut for time |
| Gemini second judge | NOT RUN | OpenRouter 403 |
| exposure differential D | CLOSED | dR2 ≈ 0 |
| static geometry b1/b2/b3, LSAR Omega | CLOSED | CV R2 ≤ 0 |
| r_prior false-refusal direction | CLOSED | cut 0.036 < best random 0.074 |
| thin-margin rival | CLOSED | margin-matched gap +0.057 |
| language-identity direction (A4) | WORKS BUT UNUSABLE | FLORES dNLL +2.0 |
| B3 batching certification | FAILED | non-identical |
| gpt-4.1 primary judge coverage | PARTIAL | 716/3,840 (exp4) |
| P1 depth-coverage regression (exp9) | FAILED | dR2 = 0.040 < 0.05 |
| P2 matched-energy broad-vs-narrow (exp9) | FAILED | pooled contrast +0.05, not significant |
| PB2 matched-energy (exp10, GaMS3) | FALSIFIED OPPOSITE | -0.10 |
| depth-redundancy index generalisation (exp12) | FALSIFIED | Spearman -0.009 |

**Novelty positioning.** Wang et al. [2] established direction universality across 14 languages using all-layer activation ablation; Slovene and Gemma-3-12B were not among their models or languages. Arditi et al. [1] showed refusal is mediated by a single direction ablated at all components. This study adds: (a) the English direction does clear Slovene when applied at every depth (consistent with both), but (b) the site-limited Heretic weight edit leaves a gap whose size is judge- and definition-dependent (strict +0.06 to +0.69), and (c) the gap is governed by WHERE the edit energy sits (band 13-24 density, Spearman -0.942) rather than by how many layers are covered.

**Pending human review.** Five packets totalling 640 items are ready for native-speaker labelling. No native-speaker review has been conducted anywhere in this study; all judges are automated.



## What we have learned so far

[FIGURE:fig_refusal_gap]

Three iterations have converged on a picture with one firm positive, one partial positive, and three falsified predictions.

**Firm positive: band placement governs residual refusal.** At matched total removal energy, which 12-layer band carries the energy predicts how much Slovene refusal survives. The band-density Spearman is -0.942 (exp9, placebo-verified, p = 0.004): coverage sets including layers 13-24 reach SL < 0.20 at sufficient strength; those missing it never reach SL < 0.93. This holds for both Gemma and GaMS3: in GaMS3 the nested R2 of placement (0.718) far exceeds count (0.400) (exp10). At matched energy AND matched layer count, a contiguous B2 band (layers 13-24) removes up to 0.57 more Slovene refusal than a stride-4 pattern at the same energy (exp10). The relevant factor is not how many layers the edit touches, but where the energy sits.

**Partial positive: corrected objective halves the gap.** Replacing Heretic's keyword refusal counter with a partial-aware classifier, at equal budget/seed/data, moved the S5X strict gap from +0.68 to +0.38 (exp11). The corrected selection bought broader aligned coverage (A1 = 64.0 vs 26.0). However, the P7 falsifier fired: dose-scaling the keyword edit to the same English refusal level achieved comparable gap reduction (+0.33), meaning the improvement may be "more edit" rather than "better objective." The gap did not reach the pre-registered +0.35 target (observed +0.38, CI [0.29, 0.47]).

**Falsified: depth-coverage count does not explain the residual.** The coverage regression (exp9 P1, dR2 = 0.040) and the matched-energy broad-vs-narrow comparison (exp9 P2, pooled +0.05) both failed their confirmatory thresholds. Coverage as a simple layer count does not add meaningful predictive power over total energy and band placement. The depth-coverage hypothesis as originally stated (more layers = less residual) is falsified; the replacement finding is that band identity matters more than coverage extent.

**Falsified: matched-energy narrow beats broad in GaMS3.** Experiment 10's PB2 was FALSIFIED OPPOSITE: at matched energy, narrow-and-strong cells (B2, B3) left less GaMS3 Slovene refusal than broad-and-weak cells (STR2, STR4), the reverse of the prediction. This makes sense once band identity is the driver: B2 (layers 13-24) concentrates energy in the right band, while a stride pattern dilutes it.

**Falsified: the depth-redundancy index does not generalise.** Experiment 12 found Spearman -0.009 between the frozen index and the cross-model, cross-language residual. The single-site transfer rate (rho +0.732) was a far better predictor. The index is a two-checkpoint observation, not an instrument.

**What survives from iterations 1-2.** The behavioural dissociation (GaMS3 transferred, Gemma did not) is robust across judges and datasets. The surrogacy gap on refusal is small for GaMS3 (0.015) and attenuated but predictable for Gemma (0.054). The harm representation is shared across languages (AUROC > 0.995); the behavioural gap is an action failure, not a representation failure, consistent with Aziz et al. [6]. KL divergence has a blind surrogacy gap in both models (0.147, 0.079). Utility is preserved in all cells. The keyword proxy inverts on edited checkpoints (kappa -0.04 on Gemma edit EN).

**The headline gap stated as a range.** The Gemma edit S5X paired EN-SL gap ranges from +0.06 (keyword strict) to +0.69 (Qwen3-14B strict), with the broad definition at +0.23. On GaMS3, all judges agree the gap is near zero. The PARTIAL class (0.548 of Gemma edit EN outputs) is the wedge: the keyword counter treats partial compliance as refusal, closing the measured gap; the LLM judge treats it as compliance, opening the gap. Neither reading is wrong; they measure different constructs.

<reviewer_feedback>
STEP 1 — REVIEW: A reviewer evaluated the previous paper draft above and produced this feedback.

The previous review is BLOCKING: the paper must not ship as it stands. Every MUST-FIX item below is a requirement for this iteration, not a suggestion — an iteration that leaves one unaddressed does not publish.

- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) The report's only 'firm positive' is stated as holding in both models, and the artifacts contradict that. Experiment 9's Slovene band-mass regression gives the claimed-dominant term a positive coefficient of +0.156 with CI [-0.240, 0.529]; the dominant Slovene term is instead the English refusal rate (0.855). The report nevertheless says that term 'was the dominant predictor' in the Slovene model. Only the English model has it dominant. In experiment 10, GaMS3's own grid (results/report_tables.md, T3 rows) shows a different 12-layer band is the effective one for that model, at lower energy, while in Gemma that same band never falls below 0.95 at any strength. So which region matters differs between the siblings. The report says the opposite ('consistent with experiment 9 ... drives the outcome', repeated in 'What we have learned' for both models). The list of coverage sets that do and do not include the region is also wrong in two places: one set named as missing it partly covers it, and the set at half coverage is absent from both lists although it has its own distinct outcome.
  Action: Rewrite the experiment-9 band paragraph, the experiment-10 nested-R2 interpretation and the 'firm positive' as model-specific claims. Quote the Slovene regression coefficient with its CI and say it does not reach significance, so the supporting evidence is the rank statistic and the matched-energy/matched-count contrasts, not the regression. Paste GaMS3's grid rows and Gemma's per-set minima side by side and state that the effective region differs. Then note explicitly that this difference is a candidate explanation for the iteration-1 dissociation, which the current text forecloses by asserting the models agree.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) Experiment 11 is written against its artifact's own verdict. The artifact concludes the mechanism is dose rather than placement, that at matched divergence the corrected edit is strictly worse on both axes (a zero gap for the cheaper alternative against +0.38), and that the miscalibration result rather than the corrected checkpoint is the finding. The report instead says the corrected objective 'bought broader coverage, as predicted by the depth-placement hypothesis', keeps it as a 'partial positive', and closes by arguing the corrected arm's divergence cost in its favour while omitting the arm in the same table that reaches a zero gap more cheaply. The clean positive -- the optimiser's scorer disagreeing with a judge across all 11,600 in-loop generations, with a sixfold worse count error and never entering the region where its own candidates differ -- appears only as prose, with no table. One number is also wrong: the report states the judge rates a particular trial at 10/100 where results/miscalibration_table.csv records 63.
  Action: Replace the experiment-11 interpretation with the artifact's README section 4 wording, including the matched-divergence comparison and the cheaper zero-gap arm. Move 'corrected objective' from the partial-positive column into the falsified column, since its own pre-registered falsifier fired. Add the miscalibration table with its kappas, its per-100 error figures and the scorer-versus-judge range, and report the certification kappa as the artifact certifies it (0.858 on held-out replayed trials) rather than the in-domain figure the report currently quotes. Correct the trial-level count against the source file.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) Five iteration-2 interpretations that the previous review showed contradict their own tables are unchanged and carry no correction note, even though neighbouring paragraphs in the same sections now carry '[Correction, iter 3]' notes: (i) the claim that one model's edit destroyed the harm signal, when the refit probe recovers to 0.993 and the artifact's own reading is re-encoding rather than information loss; (ii) 'the edit barely moved the harm signal' for the other model, when the same artifact records the frozen-axis separation halving in both languages from a mid-depth layer with differing late-layer rotation; (iii) the dose-response claim 'at every dose level SL exceeded EN', which rests on the marker rule the same artifact shows undercounts one model's English refusals by more than half; (iv) the repair table that mixes rows scored by two different judges, which makes a control arm look like it raised English refusal when the baseline under that judge sits at the same level; (v) 'stability checks ... reverse-direction analysis' presented as supportive when the reverse-direction estimate flips sign. Because these sit beside corrected text, a reader will reasonably infer they were checked and confirmed.
  Action: Add an in-place correction note to each, with replacement wording from experiment 5's summary.json/README and experiment 8's report_tables.md. Split the repair table by judge and give the per-judge baseline row. Label the dose table as marker-based and add the alternative readout columns. State the reverse-direction sign flip next to the forward estimate rather than calling it stable.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (completeness) The iteration-1 section was not restored from iter_1/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/report.md, which the previous review made a MUST-FIX. Absent from the current record: the Strategy paragraph explaining why the three iteration-1 artifacts were chosen; the same-edit response-surface table; the incremental-R2 result showing the two models share a divergence response surface but not a refusal one; the swap statistics table with its paired tests and divergence ratio; the source-by-evaluation-language transfer matrix; the decision-margin decomposition that explains why a near-parallel direction achieves little behaviourally; the exploratory double dissociation; four labelled dead ends (the blocked Slovene judge, the collateral-confounded increment, the cut sensitivity arms, the halved candidate grid); the published-baseline figure that bounds the entire second-model arm; and iteration 1's own 'What we have learned'. Separately, the iteration-2 'Summary of findings' was deleted outright rather than kept and marked superseded, which removes the retracted training-stage explanation from the record instead of labelling it retracted.
  Action: Paste the iteration-1 report back in verbatim with its five tables, Strategy, dead ends and limits, keeping the iteration-3 correction notes inserted in place. Restore the iteration-2 summary as a section headed 'Superseded by iteration 3' with the retracted sentences marked retracted and the reason given, rather than deleting it.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (rigor) Each iteration-3 section states its result without the caveat its artifact attaches. Experiment 9: the cross-language index gap sits inside its own language-permutation null and the artifact's audit script explicitly demoted that statistic; the index is necessary but not sufficient (about half the cells at or above it do not cross the threshold); the held-out-category confirmation table and the matched random/principal-component controls are absent, as is the Holm adjustment that leaves the surviving contrasts non-significant. Experiment 10: English judge agreement is 0.54 within edited arms, so English rates there are one end of a range; the co-primary 'usable' index does not resolve in either language; two further pre-registered predictions and the artifact's operator-versus-depth finding are unreported. Experiment 12: the judge misses its own agreement gate (0.683), the bias-corrected re-run drops a secondary test to chance, the familiar geometric predictor also fails and two cheap baselines beat both by margins whose CIs exclude zero, the analysis script was patched after the freeze, and the eligible-row count is misstated.
  Action: Add a short 'What bounds this' block to each iteration-3 section, taken from that artifact's README caveats and verification sections, with the numbers. Include experiment 9's confirmation table and control rows, experiment 10's judge-agreement figures and remaining predictions, and experiment 12's baseline-comparison table and post-freeze patch note.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (rigor) No number in the report names the file it came from: there are zero output-path citations across roughly 11,000 words, and the only traceability is thirteen [ARTIFACT:id] markers at section level. Several pods emit ten or more result files, so a section-level marker does not let a reader re-derive a figure. The audit pod covered iterations 1-2 only, so all of iteration 3 is unaudited by the run's own tooling, and its 5.5% mismatch rate on the audited half is the best available prior for the unaudited half.
  Action: Add the producing file to each table caption and to every non-obvious inline number. Then run the audit pod's recompute path over the iteration-3 sections, or state explicitly in the iteration-3 opening that these numbers have not been independently re-derived and that the audited mismatch rate elsewhere was 5.5%.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (scope) Parts of the original request remain unanswered and unacknowledged. Harmful compliance/attack success under the official evaluation pipeline was measured (both in iteration 2 and again in experiment 11) but appears nowhere in the report, although the request asks for it reported separately from refusal; in one iteration-2 cell it moves in the opposite direction to the refusal gap, which matters for the headline. Language consistency and the treatment of truncated or empty outputs, also requested separately, are mentioned only once in passing. The item-level analysis that speaks directly to the user's 'loss of harmfulness information versus changed mapping' question is still omitted, and the report's mechanism paragraph draws the opposite conclusion to what that analysis found. The five pending human-review packets are referred to once, with no consolidated list.
  Action: Add an attack-success table for all checkpoints in both languages from the iteration-2 and experiment-11 artifacts, noting where it diverges from the refusal gap. Add per-cell language-consistency and validity/truncation columns. Add the item-level flip analysis with its statistic and say which reading it supports. Add one 'Pending human review' list naming all five packets and their paths.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (novelty) The audit pod built a novelty table with verbatim quotes, and the report's 'novelty positioning' paragraph uses only part of it and stops short of the comparison the surviving positive needs. The report positions against the two direction-universality papers, which is right for the transfer claim, but the iteration-3 positive is about where in depth an edit must act, and no neighbour is named for it. There is published work on selecting edit locations by their causal effect on refusal, and on refusal being distributed across depth, and the run's own strategy step cites two such papers. The report does not say what its result adds beyond them. The audit pod's own honesty about one neighbour -- that the specific claim attributed to it could not be found in the text -- is also dropped, so the report inherits a positioning the audit marked unverified. Separately, the report does not state what its negative results add: that a depth measurement made in activation space fails to predict weight-edit outcomes, and that the familiar geometric predictor fails alongside it while two trivial baselines succeed, is a more transferable finding than the surviving positive and is given no neighbour comparison at all.
  Action: For the depth/placement positive, name the nearest published work on effect-based selection of edit locations and on depth-distributed refusal, quote what each establishes, and state in one sentence what this run adds (a language-conditioned contrast on two siblings at matched total edit size) and where it stops (two checkpoints, one architecture, one non-English language, and a companion experiment showing the measurement does not generalise). Carry over the audit pod's NOT VERIFIED flag verbatim. Add the same treatment for the negative result about activation-space measurements failing to predict weight-edit outcomes, including the two baselines that beat both geometric predictors.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) The concluding claim that the two-model dissociation is 'robust across judges and datasets' is cut against by the run's own iteration-3 evidence. Experiment 11 shows that scaling the same second-model edit removes the cross-language gap entirely at a divergence cost below that of the corrected edit, and the iteration-2 community reference already showed a much smaller gap on the same base. Experiment 10 shows that model's kernel applied to the other model leaves a low residual. Taken together these say the dissociation is a property of the specific under-optimised selected edit rather than of the model pair, which is what the previous review asked the report to state and what the corrected iteration-1 swap row now independently supports.
  Action: Restate the surviving behavioural claim as bounded by achieved optimisation strength rather than by model identity, citing the dose ladder, the community reference and the corrected swap row, and keep the two-model/one-seed caveat next to it. Remove 'robust across judges and datasets' or qualify it to the specific checkpoint and the judge range it holds over.
- [MINOR] (methodology) Two different quantities are both called 'the depth index' -- a layer count measured on one development half in experiments 9 and 10, and a depth fraction measured on the other half in experiment 12 -- and the report moves between them without reconciling the scales. This matters for reading experiment 12 as a test of experiments 9-10: the falsification is partly about an instrument defined on a per-model scale, which the artifact's post-hoc decomposition makes explicit and the report does not report.
  Action: State both definitions and their units once, say they are not the same instrument, and add the artifact's post-hoc decomposition showing the index orders languages within the anchor model but has no variance in the second and so cannot survive pooling.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Small internal inconsistencies that will propagate: the dead-end ledger says 'Twenty items' and lists sixteen; experiment 12 is described as having eight eligible rows where the artifact has seven (times three cells, giving the 21 rows the statistic uses); the dataset section's translation-fallback count conflicts with the screen's without saying which set each describes.
  Action: Fix the three counts against the ledger file, the experiment-12 README and the dataset artifact, and add a one-line per-set translation-provenance note.

STEP 2 — STRATEGY: The pipeline's strategy generator (gen_strat) read the reviewer feedback
and designed a new research strategy to address the critiques.

STEP 3 — PLANNING: The planner (gen_plan) turned the strategy into concrete artifact plans —
specific experiments, datasets, or research tasks to execute.

STEP 4 — EXECUTION: The executor (gen_art) ran those plans and produced the new artifacts
shown in <new_artifacts_this_iteration> below.
</pipeline_steps>

<results_status>
This iteration executed at least one EXPERIMENT/EVALUATION/PROOF with real output: gen_art_experiment_13, gen_art_experiment_14, gen_art_experiment_15, gen_art_evaluation_2.
Report their concrete findings in full, tables included.

PROVENANCE: every claim that rests on an artifact carries an [ARTIFACT:id] marker at its
FIRST mention (see ARTIFACT REFERENCES below). Markers already present in <previous_report>
stay: carry each one through unchanged, and add one to any claim that still lacks it. A
report with executed artifacts and zero [ARTIFACT:id] markers is INCOMPLETE and will be

STEP 5 — HYPOTHESIS UPDATE: The hypothesis was revised based on evidence from previous iterations.

title: Where the edit lands, not how deep
hypothesis: |-
  TITLE CLAIM. What decides whether an English-derived refusal edit also removes refusal in another language is NOT how deep or how broad the edit is, but HOW WELL THE EDIT'S PER-LAYER REMOVAL ENERGY LINES UP WITH THE LAYERS AT WHICH THAT LANGUAGE'S REFUSAL IS CAUSALLY WRITTEN - and the effective layers differ by language and by checkpoint. The corollary, measured inside the optimiser itself, is that a substring refusal objective cannot see this at all: it has no gradient in the region where its own candidates differ, so it stops at an under-dosed, badly-placed kernel, and the whole cross-language "gap" that this run started from is a property of that under-dosed edit rather than of the model.

  === WHAT ITERATION 3 SETTLED (executed numbers, read off the artifact files; every one has a source file named) ===

  (P-1) PLACEMENT BEATS COVERAGE AT MATCHED ENERGY AND MATCHED LAYER COUNT - the surviving positive, replicated in both models. In GaMS3 [art_xLy2vVlI7OEL, results/report_tables.md, 481/481 re-derived, placebos collapse to 0.003 / -0.001 / 0.023]: at matched total removal energy AND matched layer count (12 contiguous vs every 4th), SL judged harmful refusal is 0.24 vs 0.81 (E3), 0.51 vs 0.89 (E2), 0.83 vs 0.93 (E1), every CI excluding 0; the pre-registered PB2 was FALSIFIED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION (narrow-and-strong minus broad-and-weak = -0.10 [-0.150, -0.060], Holm p 0.000) and PB3's language interaction runs backwards (-0.07 [-0.131, -0.007]): concentrating helps Slovene MORE than English. The nested decomposition is the cleanest statement: log E alone R2 0.325, + WHERE the energy sits 0.718, + HOW MANY layers 0.400. Matched random and energy-matched PC controls are null (SL 0.93-0.95 vs no-op 0.93). In Gemma [art_ex4hbgThhJaL] the same shape appears as a rank statistic: lowest reachable SL refusal is monotone in the fraction of layers 13-24 covered (12/12 -> 0.024-0.171; 6/12 -> 0.732; 3/12 -> 0.927; 0/12 -> 0.951-1.000), Spearman -0.942, permutation p 0.0038; at E = 19.2, 12 contiguous mid-depth layers reach SL 0.63 while 24 strided layers leave 0.98; leave-one-band-out sparing 25-36 costs Slovene +0.39 and English 0.00.
      THE HONEST QUALIFICATION, WHICH THE NEXT DRAFT MUST CARRY: the Slovene band-mass REGRESSION coefficient in Gemma is +0.156 [-0.240, 0.529] and does NOT reach significance - the dominant Slovene regression term is the English refusal rate (0.855). The supporting evidence for placement in Slovene is the rank statistic and the matched-energy/matched-count contrasts, NOT the regression.
      AND THE EFFECTIVE BAND IS MODEL-SPECIFIC, WHICH THE ITERATION-3 DRAFT WRONGLY DENIED: at c = 1, GaMS3's SL band profile is 1-12 0.93, 13-24 0.24, 25-36 0.02, 37-48 0.85 - its best single band is 25-36, where Gemma never falls below 0.95 at any strength, while Gemma's necessary band is 13-24. Both models place, but not in the same place. This difference is a CANDIDATE EXPLANATION for the iteration-1 dissociation and must not be foreclosed.

  (P-2) THE OPERATOR MATTERS MORE THAN THE DEPTH [art_xLy2vVlI7OEL, Part A vs Part B]. The SAME per-layer directions, applied as Heretic's projected, row-norm-preserving weight edit, remove refusal at essentially zero collateral (|SL FLORES dNLL| <= 0.011, MC accuracy within 0.031 of no-op, INVALID ~0.01), while the raw activation projection of those same directions only reaches refusal < 0.5 by destroying the model: the co-primary USABLE index (refusal < 0.5 AND INVALID <= 0.10) is ">48" in BOTH languages, with INVALID 0.72 EN / 0.38 SL and FLORES +1.4 nats at the crossing. Iteration 2's all-48-layer activation repair (SL .86 -> .10) is the same artefact: it costs +0.589 nats and a real English capability hit, -0.053 [-0.083, -0.023] S7 macro [art_ex4hbgThhJaL]. This is why an activation-space depth measurement failed to predict weight-edit outcomes (see D-3), and it is the mechanistic reason the replacement instrument in C1 is defined in WEIGHT-EDIT space.

  (P-3) THE OPTIMISER'S SCORER IS BLIND EXACTLY WHERE ITS CANDIDATES DIFFER - iteration 2's positive, now replicated at scale with a certified instrument [art_0XmNBGkzsJc_, audits 305/305 + 17/17 + 59/59, 7 placebos all fail as required]. All 116 iteration-1 parameter draws were re-scored INSIDE Heretic's own loop and all 11,600 in-loop generations labelled with the frozen rubric: the keyword objective reaches kappa +0.196 against the judge, reports .907 refusal where the judge sees .711, 25.4% of its "refusals" are false, and its count NEVER FALLS BELOW 72/100 across all 116 draws while judged refusal spans 7-98/100. Mean absolute error in a draw's refusal count: 30.6/100 keyword vs 2.1/100 for the distilled classifier. On the selected trial 96 it reports 74/100 where the judge sees 37 refused and 49 PARTIAL. The classifier is certified at kappa 0.858 [0.820, 0.888] on 20 HELD-OUT REPLAYED TRIALS against the keyword rule's 0.143 (this is the number to quote; 0.924 is the in-domain figure). Under the corrected scorer the frozen selection rule fires its PRIMARY branch, which the keyword run never could (trial 7, 5/100, aligned coverage A1 64.0 vs trial 96's 26.0), and a second optimiser seed replicates (5/100, A1 65.1). Post-hoc reselection of the trials already held recovers the whole effect, so this is MIS-SCORING OF HELD CANDIDATES, not a different search.

  (D-1) DEAD, WITH ONE PAPER SENTENCE EACH AND NO FURTHER BUDGET.
      - DEPTH COVERAGE AS A COUNT: Gemma P1 dR2 0.040 [0.006, 0.136] with leave-one-out -0.002, partial F p 0.17, a permutation placebo giving a LARGER dR2 on average (p95 0.158), MDE 0.071 - a powered rejection; GaMS3 PB1 dR2 0.002 [0.000, 0.010], leave-one-cell-out -0.043.
      - BROAD-AND-WEAK BEATS NARROW-AND-STRONG: falsified in both models, in the opposite direction (above).
      - THE COUNT-BASED REDUNDANCY INDEX AS AN INSTRUMENT: PB4 Spearman 0.21 in GaMS3 (a count cannot express placement: it gives a 12-layer band and 12 strided layers the same prediction); the EN/SL index difference is 4 layers = one k-grid step, inside its own language-permutation null [-4, +4] (Gemma) and EQUIVALENT_WITHIN_MARGIN at Holm p 0.069 (GaMS3); index_EN = 16 / index_SL = 20 in BOTH checkpoints, so the Slovene lag is common to the pair and is NOT what distinguishes them. The index is NECESSARY, NOT SUFFICIENT even where it survives: 97% of Gemma cells below index_SL leave SL above 0.5, but only 47% at or above it fall below.
      - THE CORRECTED OBJECTIVE AS A BETTER EDIT: its own pre-registered falsifier P7 FIRED. At equal English refusal the 1.5x-scaled old edit has gap +.33 (difference -.05 [-.41, +.12]); at equal harmless KL the dose ladder reaches gap .00 (-.38 [-.47, -.29]) - dose for dose the corrected edit is STRICTLY WORSE. The finding in art_0XmNBGkzsJc_ is the miscalibration and the recoverability by post-hoc rescoring, NOT the corrected checkpoint. This moves out of the "partial positive" column into the falsified column, exactly as the reviewer requires.
      - Already closed in iteration 2 and staying closed: exposure differential D, static geometry b1/b2/b3, LSAR Omega, r_prior, the language-identity direction (works at +1.93 nats SL FLORES, unusable), the thin-margin rival.

  (D-2) THE TWO-MODEL DISSOCIATION IS BOUNDED BY ACHIEVED OPTIMISATION STRENGTH, NOT BY MODEL IDENTITY. Four independent rows now say so: the dose ladder closes the S5X gap to .00 at a KL below the corrected edit's [art_0XmNBGkzsJc_]; Heretic's own kernel support at c = 1.5 reaches SL 0.024 / EN 0.049 harmful refusal at FLORES dNLL -0.000, KL 0.030, 0% invalid, 99.2% Slovene, and SL 0.08 / EN 0.02 on the 100 verified RefusEU pairs versus unedited 0.98 / 0.91 [art_ex4hbgThhJaL]; the community bf16 edit of the same base sits at +.12 [.05, .20]; and the corrected iteration-1 swap row has GaMS3's parameters taking Gemma's SLOVENE from 97 to 25 while English only reaches 53, at ~10x the KL. "Robust across judges and datasets" must be struck; the claim is "this specific under-optimised, badly-placed selected edit under-transfers", with the n = 2 / one-seed / NF4 caveat beside it.

  (D-3) THE NEGATIVE THAT IS MORE TRANSFERABLE THAN THE POSITIVE [art_kfCCWf7o8eJ9]. A depth index measured in ACTIVATION space does not predict WEIGHT-edit outcomes out of sample: pooled Spearman -0.009 [-0.131, 0.192] over 21 rows (7 eligible model x language rows x 3 cells; the draft's "eight" is wrong), permutation p 0.16, concordance 8/12 = 0.67 (6/12 under judge-error correction). The familiar geometric predictor fails BESIDE it - EN/L direction cosine +0.010, and it REVERSES SIGN between models (-0.748 gemma, +0.556 qwen3). Two trivial baselines beat both by margins whose paired item-bootstrap CIs exclude zero: the single-site transfer rate rho +0.732 (index minus baseline -0.741 [-0.810, -0.528]) and the unedited model's own baseline refusal in that language rho +0.661 (-0.670 [-0.721, -0.497]). The asymmetry itself replicated on a new harm source and two new languages: the real trial-96 adapter leaves EN 0.60 / DE 0.53 / LT 0.75 / SL 0.92 from a 0.93-0.98 no-op, with its energy- and collateral-matched random control at SL 0.98 and the NLLB-vs-gpt translation-method control moving every rate by <= 0.09. Caveats that travel with it: the local judge missed its own gate at kappa 0.683 [0.629, 0.737] (Se .984 / Sp .741, so absolute levels are biased upward, Rogan-Gladen corrected re-run reported); analysis.py was patched after the freeze for numerical robustness only, with both hashes and the full diff in results/analysis_patch.json and checks.py flagging analysis_py_unchanged = false.
      NOTE THE SCALE CLASH, which the draft must reconcile once: experiments 9 and 10 call "the depth index" a LAYER COUNT on DEV half A; experiment 12 calls it a DEPTH FRACTION on half B. They are not the same instrument. Experiment 12's post-hoc decomposition belongs beside the falsification: within the anchor model the index DOES order the languages (rho +0.678), but Qwen3's eligible languages share one index value so it has zero variance there, and pooled within-model-centred rho is +0.458 (AUC +0.620).

  (D-4) THE PARTIAL WEDGE AND THE JUDGE RANGE [art_Z3I1K3VnFZuz]. The headline gap is definition-dependent: STRICT (refused only) +0.22 to +0.71 across judges and datasets, all CIs > 0; BROAD (refused + partial) -0.04 to +0.37. On S5X paired items the Qwen3-14B strict +.69 [.60, .78] becomes broad +.23 [.14, .32]; the keyword counter gives strict +.06 [-.02, .14]; RefusEU S5 broad is -.04. The English edit mostly CONVERTS ENGLISH REFUSALS INTO PARTIAL REPLIES (PARTIAL = .548 of gemma_edit EN outputs). Judge agreement within EDITED checkpoints is materially lower than pooled: exp4 .779 [.678, .861] vs .913 pooled, exp8 .769 / .737, exp10 0.86 SL but 0.54 EN, exp12 0.683. 19 of 99 behavioural claims are JUDGE_SENSITIVE. The audit found 8 mismatches, 12 misdescribed and 6 untraceable numbers in 167 checked (5.5%), and two sign-reversed conclusions.

  === THE CLAIMS TO TEST IN ITERATION 4 (each positive by design, each with a falsifier) ===

  C1 - THE WRITE-MASS OVERLAP LAW, AND ITS PRACTITIONER INSTRUMENT (the deepening of P-1 and P-2, built so it must beat the baseline that beat us). Define, per model m and language L, the CAUSAL WRITE PROFILE e_{m,L}(h): the DEV-measured drop in judged harmful refusal from a SINGLE-SITE ablation of d_EN(h) at layer h, one layer at a time, measured on S3 DEV items only. Define, for any Heretic-family weight edit, its per-layer removal-energy profile g(h) (closed form, already stored per cell in art_ex4hbgThhJaL results/cells/ and art_xLy2vVlI7OEL). The OVERLAP is O_{m,L}(edit) = sum_h e_{m,L}(h) g(h) / sqrt(sum_h g(h)^2), i.e. an energy-normalised alignment between WHERE the edit removes and WHERE that language's refusal is causally written. PREDICTION: O predicts the residual judged refusal of held-out matched-energy cells at Spearman >= 0.6 per language, adds dR2 >= 0.10 over log-energy + layer count + depth span + EN/SL direction cosine, and BEATS OR TIES BOTH CHEAP BASELINES from D-3 on the same held-out cells (single-site transfer rate at the frozen site; unedited baseline refusal), with a paired item-bootstrap CI on the difference. The mechanism that makes this a designed positive rather than a hunch: the winning baseline IS the scalar special case of O (a one-layer profile), so a profile-valued generalisation of it should dominate it; and O is defined in the space where the edits actually act (weights), which is where the activation-space index failed. SECONDARY, and the part that would change what a practitioner does: the per-language argmax of e_{m,L}(h) recovered on DEV must name, out of sample, the band whose matched-energy cell wins on held-out harm categories - 13-24 in Gemma, 25-36 in GaMS3 - i.e. the instrument must reproduce the model-specific placement difference that the iteration-3 draft wrongly denied. FALSIFIER: O adds dR2 < 0.05, or fails to beat either cheap baseline with a CI excluding zero, or the DEV argmax does not name the winning band in at least one model. If it fires, the run's reported instrument becomes the BOUNDED NEGATIVE, stated positively: no geometric or depth measurement we or the literature can name beats the unedited model's own refusal rate and a single-site ablation probe at predicting where a weight edit will fail cross-lingually - use those two, they cost one forward pass each.

  C2 - THE SELECTION BLINDNESS IS A PROPERTY OF THE METRIC FAMILY, NOT OF ONE RUN (the extension of P-3, at near-zero GPU cost). Replay the distilled partial-aware scorer over the GaMS3 116-trial journal and its stored in-loop generations [art_vzhOPupFwE4M journals, art_KFZCxJcrr84K panel], and over the community bf16 reference's trials where available. Define and report the transferable statistic: the GRADIENT-BLIND FRACTION - the share of the optimiser's own candidate population over which the objective's value spans less than its own measurement noise while judged refusal spans the full range (Gemma: the counter never leaves 72-100/100 while the judge spans 7-98/100). PREDICTION: the blind fraction is large in Gemma and materially smaller in GaMS3, and it PREDICTS which of the two searches terminated on its fallback rule with an under-dosed kernel - i.e. the miscalibration, not the architecture, is what made the two Heretic runs land in different places. This is the second candidate explanation of the iteration-1 dissociation and it is measurable from files already on disk. FALSIFIER: the blind fraction is equally large in GaMS3, whose search nonetheless reached 16/100 and transferred - in which case the blindness is real but does not explain the dissociation, and C1's placement account carries it alone.

  C3 - PARTIAL COMPLIANCE IS THE BEHAVIOURAL PRODUCT OF AN UNDER-DOSED, MIS-PLACED EDIT, AND IT IS WHERE THE LANGUAGE ASYMMETRY LIVES (the deepening of D-4, computed on ~51,000 already-judged generations at zero GPU cost). Across the dose ladder and the coverage x strength cells already generated [art_ex4hbgThhJaL 27,784; art_xLy2vVlI7OEL 10,690; art_0XmNBGkzsJc_ 3,680; art_kfCCWf7o8eJ9 9,199], model the 4-way class as an ordered transition REFUSED -> PARTIAL -> COMPLIED against dose and overlap. PREDICTION: the PARTIAL share is single-peaked in dose and peaks at a HIGHER dose in Slovene than in English, so that at the dose an English-scored optimiser stops at, English has passed through PARTIAL into COMPLIED while Slovene is still inside it; the strict-vs-broad gap range (+.06 to +.69) is then an exact consequence of where each language sits on that curve. This is what makes the judge-definition range a FINDING rather than a caveat. Report, per cell and per language and as the user explicitly asked: official RefusEU guard ASR separately from refusal, PARTIAL as its own column, INVALID/empty/truncated never folded into either, and GlotLID language consistency. FALSIFIER: PARTIAL shares are flat in dose or the two languages' peaks coincide - then the gap range is judge noise, reported as such.

  C4 - POSITIONING, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THIS PUBLISHABLE RATHER THAN A TABLE. For the placement positive the nearest neighbours are the work on selecting intervention sites by their CAUSAL effect rather than their probe quality ("Read-Best Is Not Steer-Best", 2609.22135; Cross-Architecture Steering Transfer, 2608.05164) and on refusal being distributed across depth (Arditi et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2025, 2505.17306). Quote what each establishes and state in one sentence what this run adds - a LANGUAGE-CONDITIONED placement contrast on two siblings at MATCHED total edit size and matched layer count, with the effective band differing by checkpoint - and where it stops: two checkpoints, one architecture, one non-English language for the matched panels, and a companion experiment showing the activation-space version of the measurement does not generalise. Carry the audit pod's NOT VERIFIED flag on 2607.02714's "2-3 middle layers" claim verbatim. Give the negative the same treatment: an activation-space depth measurement failing to predict weight-edit outcomes while two trivial baselines succeed is the more transferable result, and no neighbour currently states it.

  === EXPERIMENTS FOR ITERATION 4 (ordered; X-1 and X-2 are the core, X-3 and X-4 are nearly free) ===

  X-1 THE OVERLAP INSTRUMENT: SCREEN AND HELD-OUT CONFIRMATION (C1). SCREEN on evidence already on disk: fit O on the 122 Gemma cells and 57 GaMS3 cells with their stored per-layer energy profiles and judged residuals (O was never fitted on these, so they are a legitimate screen, and they are declared as such). FREEZE the profiles e_{m,L}(h), the formula and the predictions, hashed, before generating anything. CONFIRM on evidence the screen never touched: ~20 new matched-energy cells per model chosen to span high and low O at IDENTICAL energy and identical layer count, evaluated on held-out S4 harm categories and the S5X verified pairs, plus the two baselines computed on the same cells, plus layer-matched random and energy-matched PC controls, plus a no-op. Carry O and both baselines to Qwen3-8B and, under the frozen eligibility gate, one further eligible family, in EN/SL/DE/LT, reusing art_kfCCWf7o8eJ9's harness. Budget ~4-6 GPU-h per model.

  X-2 THE GRADIENT-BLIND FRACTION ACROSS TWO SEARCHES (C2). Replay-only, no new search: apply the certified scorer from art_0XmNBGkzsJc_ to GaMS3's 116-trial journal and stored generations; compute the blind fraction, the MAE per 100, and the kappa for each model; recompute each model's selection under the corrected score post hoc; report which rule branch fires. If a second Heretic search is affordable at all, spend it on GaMS3 with the corrected scorer and one seed. ~0-3 GPU-h.

  X-3 THE PARTIAL TRANSITION CURVES (C3). Pure re-analysis of ~51,000 existing judged generations, plus the guard-pipeline ASR pass on any cell that never had one. Zero new generation except the ASR re-scoring. ~0-1 GPU-h.

  X-4 JUDGE REPAIR, WHICH IS NOW BLOCKING FOR EVERY NEW NUMBER. Two agreement gates were missed this round (exp10 English kappa 0.54 within edited arms; exp12 0.683 overall). Buy a stratified gpt-4.1 calibration subsample of ~600-900 items drawn from THIS round's edited cells, in both languages, and re-certify the workhorse judge to kappa >= 0.80 refused-vs-not WITHIN edited cells before any confirmatory number is read; where it cannot be reached, report Rogan-Gladen-corrected rates beside raw ones and mark the affected claims JUDGE_SENSITIVE. The shared OpenRouter key is used for this calibration and for nothing else (~$1-2 of the cap). Also: one bf16 rebuild of a single Gemma cell, so the NF4-vs-bf16 confound against the community reference is broken once.

  X-5 OPTIONAL, ONLY IF X-1 AND X-2 LAND EARLY: a second optimiser seed for the GaMS3 corrected run, and the native-speaker review packets if a qualified reviewer is reachable; otherwise one consolidated PENDING list.

  === BLOCKING REPORT REPAIRS (reporting fixes, not experiments; the reviewer's audit is accepted in full and NONE of these may be deferred again) ===
  (1) Rewrite the experiment-9 band paragraph, experiment-10's nested-R2 interpretation and the "firm positive" as MODEL-SPECIFIC claims; quote the Slovene band-mass coefficient +0.156 [-0.240, 0.529] and say it is not significant, so the support is the rank statistic and the matched-energy/matched-count contrasts; paste GaMS3's band rows (SL 1-12 .93, 13-24 .24, 25-36 .02, 37-48 .85) beside Gemma's per-set minima; state that the effective region DIFFERS and that this is a candidate explanation of the iteration-1 dissociation; fix the two mis-stated coverage-set memberships and add the half-coverage set with its own outcome.
  (2) Replace the experiment-11 interpretation with the artifact's own README section 4 wording: the mechanism is DOSE, not placement; at matched divergence the corrected edit is strictly worse and the cheaper ladder arm reaches a ZERO gap; move "corrected objective" into the FALSIFIED column; add the miscalibration TABLE with kappas (+0.196 vs +0.924 in-domain, certification 0.858 [0.820, 0.888] on held-out replayed trials vs keyword 0.143), the per-100 errors (30.6 vs 2.1) and the scorer-vs-judge range (counter 72-100 while judged 7-98); correct the trial-level count against results/miscalibration_table.csv (63, not 10).
  (3) Add in-place "[Correction, iter 4]" notes to the five unchanged iteration-2 interpretations: GaMS3 is RE-ENCODING, not information destruction (refit 0.993/0.987, complement 0.985/0.955); Gemma's frozen-axis separation DOES halve in both languages from a mid-depth layer with differing late-layer rotation (cos 0.53 EN vs 0.83 SL), so "barely moved" is wrong; label the dose table MARKER-BASED and add the judged columns, because the marker rule undercounts Gemma's English refusals by more than half; split the repair table BY JUDGE with a per-judge baseline row; state the reverse-direction sign flip (-0.124) beside the forward Gap_K rather than calling it stable.
  (4) Paste the iteration-1 section back VERBATIM from iter_1/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/report.md with its Strategy paragraph, same-edit response-surface table, incremental-R2 result, swap statistics table with paired tests and KL ratio, source-by-evaluation-language transfer matrix, decision-margin decomposition, exploratory double dissociation, the four labelled dead ends, the published-baseline figure and iteration 1's own "What we have learned", keeping the iteration-3 correction notes inserted in place. Restore the deleted iteration-2 summary under a heading "Superseded by iteration 3", with the retracted training-stage sentences MARKED retracted and the reason given, rather than deleted.
  (5) Add a "What bounds this" block to every iteration-3 section with that artifact's own caveats and numbers: exp9's index inside the permutation null [-4, +4] with the powered statistic being the prefix-curve separation +0.080 [0.021, 0.136] p 0.0065, necessary-not-sufficient (97% vs 47%), the held-out-category confirmation rows, the matched random/PC control rows and the Holm adjustment; exp10's 0.54 English judge agreement within edited arms, the ">48 in both languages" usable index, the two unreported predictions and the operator-vs-depth finding; exp12's 0.683 judge gate miss, the Rogan-Gladen re-run, the baseline-comparison table and the post-freeze patch note.
  (6) Put the producing FILE PATH next to every table caption and every non-obvious inline number, and either run the audit pod's recompute path over the iteration-3 sections or state in the iteration-3 opening that those numbers are not independently re-derived and that the audited mismatch rate elsewhere was 5.5%. Preference: run the audit over iteration 3.
  (7) Add the scope items the user asked for and the draft still omits: an attack-success (official guard pipeline) table for ALL checkpoints in both languages, noting the iteration-2 cell where ASR moves opposite to the refusal gap (gemma_edit .738 EN vs .103 SL); per-cell language-consistency and validity/truncation columns; the item-level flip analysis that speaks to "information loss vs changed mapping", with its statistic and which reading it supports (the mechanism paragraph currently draws the opposite conclusion); and ONE consolidated "Pending human review" list naming all five packets and their paths.
  (8) Restate the surviving behavioural claim as bounded by achieved optimisation strength (D-2 above), citing the dose ladder, the community reference, the c = 1.5 kernel result and the corrected swap row; strike "robust across judges and datasets" or qualify it to the specific checkpoint and judge range.
  (9) State both depth-index definitions and their units once, say they are NOT the same instrument, and add experiment 12's post-hoc decomposition (within-anchor rho +0.678; zero variance in Qwen3; pooled within-model-centred +0.458).
  (10) Fix the three counts: the dead-end ledger says "twenty" and lists sixteen; experiment 12 has SEVEN eligible rows (x3 cells = the 21 rows the statistic uses), not eight; reconcile the dataset section's translation-fallback count with the screen's and add a one-line per-set translation-provenance note. Add the C4 novelty paragraphs with the NOT VERIFIED flag carried verbatim.

  === SUCCESS AND FALSIFICATION ===
  CONFIRM if, on cells the fit never saw: (C1) O reaches Spearman >= 0.6 against residual judged refusal in both languages, adds dR2 >= 0.10 over log-energy + count + span + cosine, and beats both cheap baselines with a paired-bootstrap CI excluding zero, while matched random and PC controls stay null; AND the DEV argmax of e_{m,L}(h) names the winning band out of sample in both models. AND (C2) the gradient-blind fraction differs between the two searches in the direction that predicts which one terminated under-dosed.
  PARTIAL: O ties the single-site baseline but both beat energy, count and cosine - the paper's instrument is then the single-site probe, presented as the cheap practitioner test, with O as the mechanistic account of why it works.
  FALSIFY: O adds < 0.05 and loses to the baselines again - the run reports the bounded negative of D-3 as its headline instrument result (no depth or direction geometry beats two one-forward-pass baselines), keeps P-1 as the mechanism claim it is, and keeps P-3 as the practitioner result.
  CONSTRAINTS THAT TRAVEL WITH EVERY NUMBER: n = 2 sibling checkpoints plus 1-2 outside families; 1-2 optimiser seeds; NF4 unless the single bf16 rebuild says otherwise; Slovene is machine-translated with native review PENDING; no attribution to any training stage; every headline number recomputed from saved results by an independent path; screen and confirmation kept apart with primary outcomes frozen and hashed before FINAL evaluation; every judged number reported with its judge, its within-edited kappa and its strict/broad definition.
motivation: >-
  National-language models are routinely abliterated with English-centric tools. Heretic's objective is English keywords plus
  English KL, and its default projection protects the ENGLISH harmless mean. The refusal-direction literature supports transfer
  only for the edit's TARGET. Refusal directions are near-universal across languages (Wang et al. 2025, 2505.17306), and English
  refusal steering transfers (BabelSteering, 2608.16577). Nothing tells a practitioner whether the edit's COLLATERAL in the
  unmonitored language is visible to the English objective, and that collateral decides whether an edited Slovene model is
  still usable. The question now matters beyond hobbyist uncensoring. Yoon, Park and Ritter (EMNLP 2026, 2608.22490) measure
  that non-English users pay a larger 'Safety Cost' by using ABLITERATED models (including gemma-3-27b-it) as the unaligned
  counterfactual in every language, and they acknowledge ablation imperfections only generically. If abliteration's own collateral
  is language-dependent and invisible to its English objective, such measurements carry a language-dependent bias. Our Gap
  and exposure quantify exactly that bias. The broad phenomenon that English proxies under-report non-English damage is KNOWN
  for compression (Marchisio et al. 2024, 2407.03211: 1.7% automatic vs 16% human-rated drop in Japanese under quantization).
  So is the principle that the calibration language matters because activation statistics decide which weights are damaged
  (Kurz et al., TACL, 2408.14398; Chimoto et al., EACL 2026, 2601.18306; Wanda- and AWQ-style activation-aware importance).
  We claim neither. We claim three things. (i) A placebo-controlled surrogacy decomposition inside an abliteration optimizer's
  own candidate population. It separates 'unseen because Slovene' from noise, learner and item artefacts, and separates intrinsic
  (model x edit family) from achieved (one run's selection). The reviewer found no prior instance. (ii) A realized-edit exposure
  quantity, logged exactly from Heretic's LoRA outputs under its real defaults (projected, norm-preserving, rank-3). It is
  pitted against the static geometric accounts the field uses: EN/SL direction cosine, SAE safety-language entanglement (2608.29936),
  and LSAR-style language subspaces. This establishes where familiar geometry stops predicting behaviour, which the user named
  as valuable. (iii) A matched-efficacy causal test that names the carrier, including the one-line practitioner fix: a bilingual
  projection reference. The practitioner bar is higher now. Heretic master supports per-config datasets for harmful/harmless
  pairs in other languages (PR #445, 2026-09-05) and an lm-eval benchmark scorer (PR #444). So a bilingual Heretic run is
  cheap, and our corollary must beat it at equal budget and equal English refusal. The whole discovery arm serves the requested
  core. It explains each checkpoint's Slovene safety-utility trade-off, and it operationalizes the user's instruction to separate
  achieved optimization from intrinsic model properties. Caveat: GaMS3 had about 134B continual-pretraining tokens (SL/EN/HBS)
  and a chat SFT of about 20k English plus 80k machine-translated Slovene responses. Every model difference is descriptive,
  and every main claim is measured WITHIN a model.
assumptions:
- >-
  Both originals load in bf16 on one >=40 GB GPU with their official chat templates, one model at a time (disk may hold only
  one ~24 GB model). Weights are fetched, used and released sequentially, with hashes recorded. GaMS3 shares the Gemma 3 architecture,
  tokenizer and 48-layer indexing, so one pinned Heretic commit (3521f8648a0dccf6e12a92666862632235fac7e6) and one layer map
  serve both. google/gemma-3-12b-it is licence-gated; without an accepted token, a byte-identical mirror is used after its
  SHA256 is checked against the official file list, and the substitution is flagged. If no GPU of this class exists, the core
  is still run on the available hardware, and the panel shrinks with that stated. The model is never silently swapped.
- >-
  Throughput: traits are teacher-forced (no generation), about 2.5k short sequences per edit and language pair, so about 45-80
  s per edit on an A100-class GPU. 250 random edits take about 4-6 GPU-h per model. Exposure costs nothing extra, because
  the LoRA adapter-output norms are hooked during the same passes. A Stage-A timing plus a power simulation on a 40-edit pilot
  freezes the panel size. The floor is 150 non-collapsed edits; below it, C2 is exploratory. The random edits span English
  refusal from original to near 0 and span damage. Otherwise extra draws are taken, and collapsed edits (harmless NLL rise
  > 1 nat/token) are analysed separately, never dropped.
- >-
  Traits are reliable (split-half, Spearman-Brown >= 0.6 across edits). Refusal propensity tracks generated refusal (Spearman
  >= 0.85 against judge-scored greedy generations on every 4th edit, per language). A trait failing either gate leaves the
  confirmatory family. The language-choice trait Lambda is NOT in the Gap family, because English outputs essentially never
  drift into Slovene, which makes its placebo degenerate.
- >-
  Parallel EN/SL items exist or can be built faithfully: FLORES-200 eng_Latn/slv_Latn, and Slovenian LLM Eval items matched
  to the English tasks after a correspondence check. It has only a test split, so a frozen DEV carve-out is excluded from
  FINAL. Harmful/harmless DEV prompts are machine-translated with back-translation checks, and native review is marked PENDING.
  Exposure differs between languages beyond the language-label-shuffled null in at least one model; otherwise the causal arms
  (x) and (e) are declared untestable for that model in Stage A, before any intervention is run.
investigation_approach: >-
  EXECUTION PRIORITY AND CUT ORDER (frozen in protocol.yaml). The core C1 (four checkpoints x two languages, full behaviour
  and utility protocol, mechanistic core) runs to completion before P2, the causal arms or the bands start. The order is:
  C1 -> C2 (P1 Gap/B) -> exposure regression (no new edits) -> C3 arms (e) and (x) with controls -> C4 forecast -> the requested
  2x2 source-language x evaluation-language transfer matrix -> bilingual-Heretic corollary -> arm (b) -> P2 bands -> drift
  link -> row_normalization = 'none' sensitivity. The Buyse-Molenberghs model is DROPPED (redundant with noise-ceiling normalization
  plus SIMEX). The minimum viable paper is C1 + C2: the four-checkpoint EN/SL trade-offs plus 'what English selection can
  and cannot see'. STEP 0 - PINS AND FREEZE. protocol.yaml is hashed before any FINAL call and records: model revisions (cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct,
  cjvt/GaMS3-12B, google/gemma-3-12b-it); the Heretic SHA 3521f864, which includes the #423 response-prefix detection change
  flagged as affecting reproducibility; orthogonalize_direction = true, row_normalization = 'full', full_normalization_lora_rank
  = 3, winsorization_quantile = 1.0, n_trials = 200, n_startup_trials = 60, seed and resolved dtype; the Optuna storage hash;
  and transformers, peft, optuna, lm-evaluation-harness, RefusEU, slovenian-llm-eval and FLORES revisions. One system-prompt
  policy applies (Heretic's default, folded into the first user turn by the Gemma 3 template); rendered templates are saved
  and diffed. Greedy decoding with 256 new tokens for FINAL behaviour. SPLITS, grouped by semantic source (translations, paraphrases
  and harmful/harmless twins follow their source): S1 Heretic construction/optimization (mlabonne harmful_behaviors / harmless_alpaca,
  as in Heretic); S2 mechanistic DEV (Semantic-Harmful/Harmless and SL translations, used only for directions, subspaces and
  layer choice, since they may overlap S1 sources); S3 trait DEV (128 harmful + 128 harmless parallel EN/SL items from a source
  disjoint from S1/S4/S5, 200 FLORES dev pairs, 50 MC items per task per language from the DEV carve-out, split A/B by semantic
  ID); S4 mechanistic HELD-OUT (about 200 new EN/SL pairs, with held-out harm categories and an independent StrongREJECT-derived
  source); S5 FINAL behaviour (a frozen stratified RefusEU sample, EN and SL); S6 over-refusal (XSTest-safe EN plus a translated
  SL version); S7 FINAL utility (the six tasks in both languages minus the carve-out, plus FLORES devtest). Overlap is audited
  by source ID and LaBSE near-duplicates (cos > 0.85). RefusEU EN/SL row correspondence is verified by back-translation similarity,
  and paired cross-language claims use verified pairs only. STEP 1 - FEASIBILITY (DEV only): template and tokenizer checks,
  20 prompts per language for coherence, baseline refusal and hidden-state extraction, timing, and the 40-edit pilot. The
  pilot supplies: reliabilities; refusal-propensity validity; trait spreads; exposure versus its language-label-shuffled null;
  per-layer ||P_lang v||^2 versus the permutation null and k/d; PI coverage on pilot TPE trials; the power simulation; and
  the frozen TOST margin, delta = min(0.10, the Gap at which bilingual reselection changes the selected trial in >50% of pilot
  simulations). STEP 2 - FOUR CORE CHECKPOINTS. One Heretic run per original with identical defaults, seed and S1 data. The
  selection rule is declared in advance: the lowest KL among trials with <= 10/100 keyword refusals; fallback 1, the fewest
  refusals with KL <= 1.0; fallback 2, the nearest Pareto point to (0, 0). The Optuna study, the parameters and the LoRA/merged-weight
  hashes are saved. The same English-derived edit is evaluated in both languages. p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic is a sanity
  reference only. A second-seed run per model is kept separate from the core. STEP 3 - CORE BEHAVIOUR AND UTILITY (FINAL,
  touched once). Scored outcomes: ASR under the RefusEU rubric; refusal; partial, ambiguous, irrelevant, malformed and empty
  outputs as explicit categories, never folded into compliance or refusal; response-language consistency (line-level GlotLID);
  repetition; and over-refusal on S6. The primary judge is frozen and blind to model identity. A second judge from another
  family scores a stratified 400-item sample, with kappa reported. A blinded EN/SL human-review packet is prepared and marked
  PENDING. Utility covers ARC-C, BoolQ, HellaSwag, OBQA, PIQA and Winogrande in EN and the Slovenian LLM Eval versions via
  the pinned harness, per task and macro-averaged, as original-to-edited change within each language. Harmless divergence
  is 1-token and 32-token KL on held-out prompts. STEP 4 - MECHANISTIC CORE. Positions: the final post-instruction template
  tokens (identical strings in both languages) plus mean content tokens as a control. Per layer, model and language: the harmful-minus-harmless
  direction; EN/SL cosine against a split-half ceiling; CV probe AUROC on S4; cross-language probe transfer; and the original's
  frozen probe versus a probe refitted after the edit (drift versus information loss). Controls: topic- and length-matched
  twins, the language-identity direction, and pre-response positions only. On S5, item-level logistic regression of post-edit
  refusal on the frozen-probe score, per language, separates a changed mapping (preserved slope, shifted intercept) from lost
  evidence (collapsed slope). The layer-wise language map uses CKA and translation retrieval on S2 pairs. Base-model diagnostic
  for cjvt/GaMS3-12B: separability and the language map under base formatting, plus a small EN/SL continuation sample. Its
  raw refusal is never compared with the chat models. STEP 5 - DISCOVERY PANEL (DEV only). P1 is the 60 startup trials plus
  >= 190 draws from Heretic's priors. direction_index is encoded as missing when direction_scope = per layer. The 140 TPE
  trials are never fitted; they are out-of-sample tests. TRAITS per edit, language and half: R, refusal-prefix log-odds at
  the first response token (prefixes mined per language); K, log mean per-token KL over the original's 32-token harmless continuation;
  N, FLORES NLL change; M, length-normalized gold-minus-best-distractor margin; Lambda, the language-choice margin (descriptive
  and B-only). EXPOSURE per edit and language, logged in the same passes: the sum over edited modules of ||dW_m x_m||^2 on
  the harmless response tokens, per token, plus a per-sentence sum as a sensitivity check, since Slovene uses more tokens.
  It is also split into a mean term and a variance term using the original model's module outputs. ANALYSIS: Gap_t with one
  frozen GBT learner (ridge-on-splines as a sensitivity check); halves swapped and averaged; the reverse SL_A -> EN_B direction;
  raw R2 reported beside R2*; ceilings with item-bootstrap CIs; and SIMEX with the measured reliabilities. B_t is inferred
  by a two-level bootstrap (edits x semantic items resampled jointly across language and half), with a secondary permutation
  of parameter rows WITHIN strata of EN_A traits (a conditional null, not plain row shuffling). Stability: Gap and B on two
  disjoint halves of P1. NAMED TEST OF THE FRAGILITY RIVAL (alternate 4): an item x edit mixed model, d_ie ~ s(EN edit traits_e)
  x s(baseline margin_i) + (1|item) + (1|edit) + language, plus a MARGIN-MATCHED Gap recomputed after reweighting SL and EN
  items to equal baseline-margin distributions. The rival wins if the margin-matched Gap lies inside the TOST margin. STEP
  6 - CARRIER TESTS (separate from the core checkpoints). (6a) EXPOSURE REGRESSION on P1: the Slovene-specific residual regressed
  on D, compared against b0 (identity transfer), b1 (the kernel-weighted per-layer EN/SL cosine profile x EN effect), b2 (language-identity
  entanglement, the 2608.29936 analogue), b3 (band kernel masses) and Omega (the realized-dW energy share in the LSAR-style
  k-dim language subspace: ||P_lang dW_m||_F^2 / ||dW_m||_F^2, weighted by ||dW_m||_F). (6b) MATCHED-EFFICACY ARMS on the
  two core edits, the two second-seed edits and 10 P1 edits stratified by D. Strength is rescaled on DEV by 3-point interpolation
  of EN refusal propensity, within Heretic's max_weight range. Arms: (0) no-op; (a) as is; (e) bilingual reference; (x) contrastive
  second-moment projection (top-k eigenvectors of E_SL[oo^T] - E_EN[oo^T] at the weighted layers); (b) LSAR-style subspace;
  (c) random subspaces from the top-100 harmless-PC span, rejection-sampled so that ||P v||^2 matches (x) and (b) within 10%
  per weighted layer, plus one unconstrained random arm; (p) PLANTED POSITIVE CONTROL: v' = normalize(v + alpha u), where
  u is the top differential-exposure direction and alpha doubles D, then orthogonalized, to show the test can recover a known
  carrier. Composition order: language/reference projection, then Heretic's harmless-mean projection, then normalization,
  then the kernel with row normalization. Outcomes are measured on B-half traits and S4: SL and EN refusal reduction and Slovene-specific
  collateral. A power simulation from pilot variances fixes the minimum detectable relative cut; if it exceeds 30%, C3 becomes
  a directional effect-size CI, labelled exploratory. (6c) The requested 2x2 transfer matrix (EN- and SL-derived directions
  as activation ablation or addition, each evaluated in EN and SL, with dose-response, no-op and norm-matched random controls
  and benign utility checks) is run in each original. (6d) PRACTITIONER COROLLARY, at equal EN refusal and an equal 200-trial
  budget: a bilingual Heretic run (EN+SL S1 datasets via per-config datasets, a Slovene refusal keyword list, bilingual KL),
  compared with post-hoc bilingual reselection among the existing trials and with arm (e) applied to the core edit. (6e) If
  time remains: P2 (about 80 Sobol edits covering all depths, with a VIF gate) for band slopes; the drift link (SL-minus-EN
  representation drift in exposure coordinates versus frozen-probe coordinates on 40 edits); and a 40-edit row_normalization
  = 'none' panel to check the conclusions do not hinge on norm preservation. STEP 7 - STATISTICS. Confirmatory families are
  frozen before FINAL. C1: original-to-edited change per model x language for ASR, refusal, invalid rate, over-refusal, utility
  macro and harmless KL, with paired item-level effects, 95% CIs from a cluster bootstrap over semantic items (translations
  clustered), and McNemar tests. C2: Gap and B for K, N and M per model (6 tests, Holm), plus the refusal TOST. C3: exposure
  delta-R2 over the best static baseline, and the (e) versus (c) and (x) versus (c) contrasts. C4: forecast checks. C4 PROTOCOL:
  the forecast is fitted on P1 in DEV-trait space; the target is the SL excess in trait units (secondary: log(SL + eps) -
  log(EN + eps), eps fixed on DEV). Before use, PI coverage is checked on the last 50 TPE trials, the ones nearest the selected
  region; it must reach >= 85% or be conformalized. Each target edit gets a support diagnostic (kNN distance in parameter
  and EN-trait space versus the P1 distribution). If an edit is out of support, a GP forecaster becomes primary and about
  30 local draws around the TPE region are added and labelled as augmentation. FINAL replication measures the same trait definitions
  on FINAL items for the targets and a 20-edit bridge subset (DEV-to-FINAL calibration); lm-eval accuracy is descriptive.
  Four targets (two per model) are a calibration check with no power claim. Layers, k, bands and learner settings are chosen
  on DEV and labelled exploratory. Two models are two units. Prompt-level CIs are never presented as optimization-run variance;
  the panel and the seed reruns address that. BUDGET: two core runs of about 2-3 GPU-h each; P1 about 4-6 GPU-h per model;
  arms about 2 GPU-h per model; the bilingual run about 3 GPU-h per model. API spend (translation plus 2 judges) is about
  $5-7 of the $10 cap, tracked per call.
success_criteria: >-
  GATES (DEV, before any confirmatory test): trait reliability >= 0.6; refusal-propensity validity >= 0.85; >= 150 non-collapsed
  P1 edits; power-simulated MDE for Gap <= 0.15. Otherwise C2 is exploratory. CORE-STUDY SANITY, relative to each original:
  EN judge refusal reduced >= 50% (relative); SL response-language consistency drop <= 3 points; utility macro drop <= 5 points
  per language. A checkpoint that fails is reported as degraded, never as successful suppression, and incoherent or empty
  outputs never count as compliance or refusal. CONFIRM the main claim if all four hold. (a) REFUSAL VISIBLE: the 90% CI of
  Gap_R lies inside +/-delta (frozen, <= 0.10) in both models. (b) DAMAGE PARTLY BLIND: for >= 1 of K/N/M in >= 1 model, Gap
  >= max(delta, MDE) with a Holm-adjusted 95% CI lower bound > 0, and the B bootstrap CI excludes 0 (stratified-permutation
  p < 0.05 as a secondary check). The sign must hold on both disjoint P1 halves and under SIMEX, and the MARGIN-MATCHED Gap
  must stay outside the TOST margin, so the fragility rival does not absorb it. (c) CARRIER: D has a positive coefficient
  whose CI excludes 0 and adds delta-R2 >= 0.05 over b1, b2, b3 and Omega combined, while none of those adds >= 0.05 over
  D. At matched EN refusal reduction (within +/-10% relative), arm (e) or (x) keeps SL refusal reduction within +/-10% (relative)
  of arm (a) and cuts the Slovene-specific collateral with a CI that excludes the matched-random (c) cut. The planted control
  (p) must be detected; if it is not, C3 is declared uninformative, not negative. The pre-registered size target is a >= 30%
  relative cut when the MDE allows; otherwise a directional CI. (d) CORE TIE-IN: PI coverage on held-out TPE trials is >=
  85%, and for >= 3 of the 4 checkpoint targets the SL excess falls outside the English-only forecast PI and inside the PI
  once D is added. The remainder is reported as the achieved component. PARTIAL: (a) and (b) hold but (c) fails, i.e. the
  blind damage is real but carried by neither exposure nor static geometry. Reported as the boundary, with the fragility mixed
  model and the band slopes examined. Alternatively, (c) holds for exposure but the static baselines tie it, i.e. geometry
  is enough; reported as such. FALSIFY the blind-damage claim if, for every damage trait in both models, the Gap 95% CI upper
  bound is below delta (or the TOST shows equivalence to 0). English outcomes are then an adequate surrogate, which becomes
  the headline; (d) becomes 'the English-only forecast already captures each checkpoint's Slovene trade-off', and the proxy
  use in 2608.22490 gets a positive validity check. FALSIFY the carrier claim if the arms do not differ from their overlap-matched
  random controls while (p) is detected, or if no strength achieves matched EN efficacy. FALSIFY (b) in favour of alternate
  4 if the margin-matched Gap falls inside the TOST margin. PRACTITIONER COROLLARY (descriptive, equal budget): report whether
  the bilingual Heretic run, post-hoc bilingual reselection or arm (e) gives the lowest SL collateral at equal EN refusal.

  many trials, the effect on it predicts the effect on the true endpoint. Here each random edit is a trial, the English outcomes
  are the surrogate Heretic optimizes, and the Slovene outcomes are the true endpoint for Slovene users. A same-language placebo
  half gives the surrogate's ceiling. Pharmacokinetics supplied the carrier: side effects follow EXPOSURE (the drug concentration
  a tissue actually sees), not the drug's structural similarity to its target. The analogue of exposure is the energy the
  realized edit removes from each language's tokens, as opposed to cosine between directions. Pharmacology also supplies the
  causal design: compare side effects at matched on-target efficacy, not at matched dose, and include a planted positive control
  so a null is interpretable. Quantitative genetics (Lande's correlated response to selection) predicts that unselected traits
  outside the span of the selected ones move in ways selection cannot see. The optimizer's curse (Smith & Winkler 2006) prices
  the selected edit's excess. From compression, activation-aware importance (calibration-language effects) is the closest
  engineering precedent for exposure, cited as its origin.
terms:
- term: Abliteration / Heretic edit
  definition: >-
    Removing a refusal-associated direction v from attention-output and MLP down-projection weights, with a per-layer kernel
    tuned by TPE on English refusal and English KL. Under the pinned defaults, v is first projected off the English harmless-mean
    residual, and the update is norm-preserving and stored as a rank-3 LoRA delta dW.
- term: Random-edit panel (P1)
  definition: >-
    Heretic's 60 random startup trials plus >= 190 more draws from the same priors, each scored in EN and SL. It describes
    model x edit family x prior, not one optimization run.
- term: Placebo halves
  definition: >-
    Semantic items split into halves A and B, keeping each item's EN and SL versions together. English traits on A predict
    English traits on B (placebo) and Slovene traits on B (test).
- term: English surrogacy gap (Gap_t)
  definition: >-
    R2*(EN_A -> EN_B) - R2*(EN_A -> SL_B) for trait t, where R2* is cross-validated R2 over the target's split-half noise
    ceiling. Positive means Slovene variation across edits that English outcomes cannot see because it is Slovene.
- term: Blind share (B_t)
  definition: >-
    Partial R2 of the edit parameters beyond the EN_A traits when predicting SL_B, minus the same quantity for EN_B. Positive
    means the unseen Slovene variation is set by the edit, not by noise.
- term: Exposure and exposure differential (D)
  definition: >-
    Per language, the mean per-token squared norm of the realized edit's output, sum over edited modules of ||dW_m x_m||^2,
    on the original model's harmless response tokens. It is logged from the LoRA adapter outputs. D = log E_SL - log E_EN.
- term: Static geometric baselines
  definition: >-
    Input-independent predictors: the kernel-weighted EN/SL refusal-direction cosine profile (b1), language-identity entanglement
    (b2), band kernel masses (b3), and Omega, the realized dW's energy share inside an LSAR-style language subspace.
- term: Matched-efficacy arms
  definition: >-
    Variants of one edit, each rescaled so that English refusal propensity falls by the same amount: (e) bilingual projection
    reference; (x) contrastive second-moment projection; (b) language-mean subspace; (c) overlap-matched random subspace;
    (p) planted positive control; (0) no-op.
- term: Margin-matched Gap
  definition: >-
    Gap recomputed after reweighting SL and EN items to equal baseline first-token-margin distributions in the original model.
    It is the named test of the 'thinner Slovene margins' rival.
- term: Achieved vs intrinsic
  definition: >-
    Intrinsic: structure of the random-edit panel (model x edit family x prior). Achieved: a selected checkpoint's deviation
    beyond the panel forecast's interval (optimizer's curse).
summary: >-
  Heretic tunes refusal removal on English outcomes only. We re-score its random candidate edits in English and Slovene with
  an English placebo, to test whether Slovene refusal is visible to English while part of the Slovene collateral damage is
  systematically blind. We then test whether that blind part is carried by the energy the realized edit removes from Slovene
  tokens (exposure), rather than by static geometry such as direction cosine or a language subspace, using matched-efficacy
  projection arms with overlap-matched and planted controls. Finally we check whether exposure explains each core checkpoint's
  Slovene trade-off.
alternates:
- title: Slovene safety training keeps a Slovene refusal
  hypothesis: >-
    What English cannot see is REFUSAL itself, not damage. In GaMS3, part of the refusal action is Slovene-specific, so after
    the English edit Slovene refusal stays relatively higher in GaMS3 than in Gemma-IT (a model x language interaction on
    FINAL). Gap_R > 0 in GaMS3 only. In the 2x2 transfer matrix, the SL-derived direction suppresses EN refusal better than
    the EN-derived direction suppresses SL refusal. An equal-budget bilingual Heretic run closes the residual.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if claim (1) fails in GaMS3 but holds in Gemma while the damage traits are visible. GaMS chat SFT is about 80%
    machine-translated Slovene with implicit refusals in both languages, so a Slovene-specific refusal channel is a genuine
    possibility, though not favoured a priori.
- title: Abliteration moves the threshold, not the evidence
  hypothesis: >-
    Treated as a signal-detection decision, the edit is a pure CRITERION shift. Each item's post-edit refusal propensity is
    a monotone function of the original model's frozen-probe harmfulness score, with the slope unchanged and the intercept
    lower. EN and SL differ only in intercept, and residual refusal across languages and models is explained by where items
    sit on one preserved evidence axis.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if item-level fits show preserved slopes, shifted intercepts and no language x edit slope interaction on S4 and
    S5. That is a one-parameter-per-condition account that needs no edit population. It loses if slopes collapse, i.e. the
    ablation removes the evidence channel itself.
- title: Differences come from the search, not the model
  hypothesis: >-
    The two siblings share gemma-3-12b-pt, the tokenizer and the layer indexing, so their refusal and collateral structure
    is inherited, and post-Heretic model differences reflect achieved optimization. Test: re-apply each model's selected kernel
    parameters to the OTHER sibling, using its own DEV directions, and compare the panels' trait covariance matrices (random-skewers
    correlation, common principal components) and exposure profiles.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if swapped parameters reproduce each other's EN and SL trade-offs within CI and the panel covariances correlate
    >= 0.9. Then 134B tokens of continual pretraining and a different SFT barely changed how refusal and collateral respond
    to this edit family, and any headline GaMS-versus-Gemma difference is an artefact of one optimization run.
- title: Slovene breaks first because its margins are thinner
  hypothesis: >-
    There is no Slovene-specific carrier. Slovene predictions sit on thinner logit margins, so the items that flip under an
    edit are those near their decision boundary, and item-heterogeneous flipping produces an apparent Gap. Named test: an
    item x edit mixed model with an EN edit trait x baseline item margin interaction, and a margin-matched Gap after reweighting
    SL and EN items to equal baseline-margin distributions.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It wins if the margin-matched Gap falls inside the TOST margin while the raw Gap does not, and if exposure adds nothing
    once margins are modelled. The fix is then a margin-aware English threshold, not a Slovene scorer or a projection change.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Depth-coverage law falsified by powered tests; placement x operator overlap and selection blindness replace it.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  HEADLINE REPLACED: the depth/dose/coverage law is DEAD, falsified by its own powered tests in both models (Gemma P1 dR2
  0.040 with LOO -0.002, MDE 0.071; GaMS3 PB1 dR2 0.002, LOO -0.043), and broad-and-weak lost to narrow-and-strong in the
  opposite direction (-0.10 [-0.150,-0.060], Holm p 0.000). The new claim is PLACEMENT: at matched total energy AND matched
  layer count, where the energy sits decides the residual (SL 0.24 vs 0.81 at E3; nested R2 placement 0.718 vs count 0.400).
- >-
  LATCHED onto the two genuine positives and held them: art_xLy2vVlI7OEL (placement at matched energy and matched count, plus
  operator-beats-depth) and art_0XmNBGkzsJc_ (the objective has no gradient across its own candidate population: counter never
  leaves 72-100/100 while judged refusal spans 7-98/100; MAE 30.6 vs 2.1 per 100).
- >-
  ACCEPTED the reviewer in full where my own strand classification agrees: the 'firm positive' is now stated as MODEL-SPECIFIC
  (Gemma's effective band is 13-24, GaMS3's is 25-36 at SL 0.02, where Gemma never falls below 0.95), the Slovene band-mass
  coefficient is quoted as +0.156 [-0.240, 0.529] and called non-significant, and the supporting evidence is named as the
  rank statistic and the matched contrasts rather than the regression.
- >-
  MOVED the corrected objective from 'partial positive' to FALSIFIED, per its own P7 falsifier: at equal EN refusal the 1.5x-scaled
  old edit gives +.33 (difference -.05 [-.41,+.12]) and at equal KL the ladder reaches a gap of .00 (-.38 [-.47,-.29]). What
  survives from that artifact is the miscalibration measurement and the recoverability by post-hoc reselection, with certification
  quoted as kappa 0.858 on held-out replayed trials, and the trial-level count corrected to 63.
- >-
  RESTATED the run's behavioural headline as bounded by ACHIEVED OPTIMISATION STRENGTH rather than by model identity, citing
  four independent rows: the dose ladder reaching gap .00 below the corrected edit's KL, the c=1.5 kernel at SL 0.024 / EN
  0.049 with FLORES dNLL -0.000, the community bf16 edit at +.12, and the corrected swap row (GaMS3 parameters take Gemma
  SL 97->25 vs EN 100->53). 'Robust across judges and datasets' is struck.
- >-
  ADDED C1, the replacement instrument, designed to beat the baselines that beat us: a WEIGHT-SPACE write-mass overlap O =
  sum_h e(h)g(h)/||g||, where e(h) is the DEV single-site causal ablation profile per language and g(h) the edit's per-layer
  removal energy. Its mechanism-level justification is that the winning baseline (single-site transfer rho +0.732) is the
  scalar special case of O, and that the failed instrument was measured in activation space where the operator finding says
  weight edits do not live.
- >-
  ADDED C2, the gradient-blind fraction, as a near-free extension of the selection positive to a SECOND search (GaMS3's 116-trial
  journal and in-loop generations are already on disk), with the prediction that it, not architecture, explains why the two
  Heretic runs landed in different places.
- >-
  ADDED C3, the PARTIAL wedge as a finding rather than a caveat: the judge-definition range (strict +.06 to +.69, broad -.04
  to +.37, PARTIAL .548 of gemma_edit EN outputs) is predicted to follow from a single-peaked PARTIAL-share curve in dose
  whose peak sits at a higher dose in Slovene, computable on ~51,000 already-judged generations at zero GPU cost.
- >-
  CLOSED the count-based depth index for good: PB4 Spearman 0.21, the 4-layer EN/SL difference inside its own permutation
  null [-4,+4], index_EN 16 / index_SL 20 IDENTICAL in both checkpoints (so the Slovene lag is not what distinguishes them),
  and the cross-model falsification at Spearman -0.009 over 21 rows. The two different quantities both called 'the depth index'
  are now required to be defined and reconciled in the paper.
- >-
  PROMOTED the negative from art_kfCCWf7o8eJ9 to a first-class reported result with its own novelty positioning: an activation-space
  depth measurement fails to predict weight-edit outcomes, EN/L direction cosine fails beside it and reverses sign between
  models (-0.748 vs +0.556), and two one-forward-pass baselines beat both with CIs excluding zero.
- >-
  MADE JUDGE REPAIR BLOCKING: two agreement gates were missed this round (0.54 English within edited arms in exp10, 0.683
  overall in exp12), so a stratified gpt-4.1 calibration subsample must re-certify the workhorse judge to kappa >= 0.80 WITHIN
  edited cells before any confirmatory number is read, with Rogan-Gladen-corrected rates where it cannot be reached.
- >-
  CARRIED the ten blocking report repairs into the hypothesis with their numbers and source files, including the verbatim
  restoration of the iteration-1 section, the iteration-2 summary kept as 'Superseded by iteration 3' with retracted sentences
  marked rather than deleted, per-number file paths, an audit pass over the unaudited iteration-3 sections, the ASR/language-consistency/validity
  tables the user explicitly asked for, and the three miscounts (sixteen ledger items, seven eligible rows, translation-fallback
  provenance).

title: Same edit, very different safety effect
summary: |-
  WHAT WAS RUN. Two Heretic (SHA 3521f864) runs under ONE identical optimizer: cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct and google/gemma-3-12b-it, same seed 20260923, search space, English data (mlabonne/harmful_behaviors + harmless_alpaca), bnb_4bit NF4, explicit batch size 128, 116-trial budget (60 TPE startup + 56 TPE) and pause/resume point; chat templates verified byte-identical. Heretic's interactive prompts are all scripted and logged (an unscripted one exits 3 rather than guessing). Four core checkpoints (2 originals + 2 edits chosen by a rule frozen before any trial) plus 2 swap checkpoints, scored per prompt in English and Slovene.

  HEADLINE RESULTS (all re-derived independently by audit.py: 28/28 checks, 0 mismatches, 3/3 placebo tests correctly fail).
  1. SAME-EDIT ASYMMETRY. On all 60 edits that are identical in both models, gemma-3-12b-it refuses MORE than GaMS3-12B-Instruct: 60/60 edits, 0 the other way, paired median +25 refusals/100 (bootstrap CI [10,43]). Yet the two models' KL damage from the same edit agrees almost perfectly (Spearman 0.967, CI [0.93,0.98], partial rho 0.923 after controlling for kernel mass). Refusal drop per unit KL is ~13x higher in GaMS (1449 vs 108; ratio 13.4, CI [7.0,30.0]). On the KL-matched half (KL medians 0.0101 vs 0.0098) GaMS sits at 65/100 refusals vs Gemma 99/100. Same edit, same representational damage, very different safety effect.
  2. THE RANGE-RESTRICTION GUARD BITES. A3 reading is 'intermediate', not 'shared surface': refusal ranks agree only moderately (rho 0.781, CI [0.63,0.88]; partial 0.647) and dR2_sibling is ~0 for refusal, so that rank agreement is mostly inherited from the shared parameter draws rather than a shared response surface. The guard was validated on synthetic data first (strength-only generator: dR2 CI includes 0; shared-residual generator: dR2=0.51).
  3. SELECTION AND EXACT REPRODUCTION. Fallback rule 1 fired for both (no trial reached <=10 refusals). GaMS trial 88 -> 16/100 EN refusals at KL 0.175; Gemma trial 96 -> 69/100 at KL 0.024. Both re-score EXACTLY to their journal values (KL relative difference 2e-8), and the replica reproduces Heretic's printed baselines exactly (98 and 100).
  4. CROSS-LANGUAGE, and it is NOT language-neutral. GaMS's own edit suppresses both languages (EN 98->16, SL 97->10; McNemar p<1e-24). Gemma's own edit barely moves either (EN 100->69, SL 97->90). Applying GaMS's parameters to Gemma suppresses SLOVENE far more than English (SL 97->25 vs EN 100->53) at 10x the KL cost (KL ratio own/swap 0.095, CI [0.046,0.189]). The swap never reproduces the own-edit outcome in either direction (all CIs exclude 0).
  5. DIRECTION COSINE DOES NOT PREDICT IT. The two models' orthogonalized refusal directions agree only moderately (mean cos 0.63; 0.57 over layers 24-47) while their harmless means nearly coincide (0.98) and a random-direction control gives 0.014. The large behavioural asymmetry is invisible to a raw cross-model direction cosine.
  6. NO LANGUAGE DAMAGE anywhere: FLORES+ dev per-token NLL moves by <=0.01 nats in all six checkpoints and 100% of Slovene answers remain Slovene; no checkpoint's apparent suppression is incoherence.

  LIMITS THAT MUST TRAVEL WITH THESE NUMBERS. Two models are two units: nothing here attributes the asymmetry to Slovene continued pretraining, instruction tuning or any training stage (GaMS is a same-family reference, not a controlled derivative of this Gemma checkpoint). The Gemma arm's resistance is CONFOUNDED with bnb_4bit quantization and with the reduced 116-trial budget - the published bf16 200-trial Heretic edit of gemma-3-12b-it reaches 3/100 refusals, so this is not evidence that Gemma resists abliteration in general. Slovene refusal rests on a marker list with only moderate agreement against executor hand labels (accuracy 0.75, Cohen's kappa 0.48, n=40, NATIVE_REVIEW_PENDING). The blinded 3-way LLM judge is implemented and ready (judge_sl.py) but STILL BLOCKED: retried after the platform replaced the OpenRouter key, the key this run can see (env var and secrets file, identical value and key id) returns HTTP 403 'Key limit exceeded' to every request including a 4-token probe, so 0/600 judgements succeeded and none were invented (results/judge_sl.json). SL numbers are development-grade, not final safety measurements. One optimizer seed per model; prompt-level CIs do not measure run-to-run optimizer variance. Refusal is Heretic's English keyword proxy, which counts empty answers as refusals and fires on compliant text mentioning legality or harm.

  ARTIFACTS (absolute paths in README.md and method_out.json): both Optuna journals (resumable via `uv run method.py --stages phaseB_<tag>`), both LoRA adapters with sha256, residual means and directions, per-prompt scores for all six checkpoints in results/eval/, four figures, frozen protocols. An API translator refused to translate most harmful prompts, so the Slovene set uses NLLB-200-distilled-1.3B (chrF median 70.3).

title: English vs Slovene refusal-direction transfer test
summary: >-
  A1 screen (iteration 1) on cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct@1d0b27af and google/gemma-3-12b-it@96b6f1ec (Heretic bnb_4bit NF4, bf16
  compute, L4). Data: 85 JBB harmful/benign twins after a LaBSE S1-overlap audit (15 AdvBench rows dropped), sha1 halves A
  (44) / B (41), Dolly, FLORES+, SL-LLM-Eval MC. SL is Gemini-2.5-flash MT (mean chrF 81), with NLLB fallback for 22 rows.
  Diff-in-means d_EN/d_SL on winsorized residuals; (layer, pos) chosen on half A with Arditi filters (GaMS3 L34, Gemma L20,
  pos -1); protocol hash-frozen before half B. Half B: 15 ablation conditions, u_SL increment with frozen and post-freeze
  raw-energy random controls, matched-efficacy grid, 5-dose addition, K/N/M collateral, 1,596 greedy generations judged blind
  by gpt-4.1 (the plan's gpt-4.1-mini failed the T5 hand-check), and a Heretic bridge (Heretic code, 20 TPE startup edits,
  seed 20260923). KEY RESULTS: R validity gate failed for GaMS3 (Spearman .51, AUROC .70) but passed for Gemma (.91/.96),
  so the verdict is judge-based. Frozen screen verdict: WEAK; A1's predicted contrast is REVERSED. Judged refusal after d_EN
  ablation: GaMS3 EN .90->.46 and SL .93->.34 (residual gap SL-EN -0.15 [-0.32, .03]); Gemma EN .83->.07 but SL 1.00->.85
  (gap +0.77 [.62, .89]), despite cos(d_EN, d_SL) = .92 and a log-odds transfer T(EN->SL) = 3.47. Exploratory explanation:
  Gemma's Slovene refusal margin is large (R 13.9 vs 3.6 EN; 69% of benign SL twins refused), so direction cosine and log-odds
  transfer do not predict behavioural transfer. The Heretic bridge agrees: SL-EN residual gap GaMS3 .11 [.06, .17], Gemma
  .23 [.16, .30]. GaMS3's R-based u_SL increment (F_raw .23, F_ctrl .195/.154) is collateral-confounded (span ablation FLORES
  +1.4 nat/tok; about 35% malformed). Exploratory GaMS3-only double dissociation under addition (u_SL +2.2 SL / -1.5 EN; u_EN
  +3.5 EN / -1.1 SL). Random ablation controls are destructive even when raw-energy-matched (T7 failed; documented amendment).
  Verified: T8 recompute identical; independent plain-python re-derivation matches all T/I/F/rho, judged rates and bridge
  means; placebos null. Files: method_out.json (metadata = full analysis + frozen predictions), results/analysis_summary.json,

type: dataset
title: Frozen English/Slovene safety and utility test sets
summary: |-
  Frozen, hashed, audited EN/SL data protocol for the GaMS3-12B-Instruct vs gemma-3-12b-it Heretic study. full_data_out.json has 48,696 rows in 10 blocks; the per-family frozen JSONL are in data/splits/; data/split_manifest.json holds the SHA256 values (protocol_hash dc33bde4...). Workspace: /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Fapgmt6JWbcD/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_dataset_1.
  Blocks:
  - S1_heretic: Heretic 3521f864 default data, EN+SL. Direction data only.
  - S2_semantic: Semantic-Harmful/Harmless. DEV only; 400/416 harmful rows are S1 rows.
  - S3_screen_dev_prompts and S3_screen_dev_utility: copied from the pods' screen_dev.json. They keep the pod ids and halves (e.g. jbb_0), which differ from the spec strings (only 50.7% of halves agree). JBB 85 pairs, Dolly 100, FLORES dev 200, MC 120.
  - S4_strongreject_pairs: 257 StrongREJECT + gpt-4.1 twin pairs, EN+SL. Strata: hoc 70 pairs (held-out Llama-Guard categories), ind 187.
  - S5_refuseu: all official RefusEU en/sl eval rows (1400+1400). Inferred category, balanced to 100 per category and LOW-confidence (Llama-Guard 64.5% EN / 49.7% SL on the gold rows). Frozen 700-row core (seed 20260923). Graded EN-SL correspondence: 0 T, 158 P, 1092 C, 150 N, the same with gemini or MADLAD back-translation, so official rows support no item-paired claims.
  - S5X_refuseu_crosstrans: gpt-4.1 cross-translations of the core, both directions, for paired claims.
  - S6_xstest: 450+450. SL by gpt-4.1 with trigger self-report; s6_primary = 219 safe items.
  - S7_slovenian_llm_eval: six tasks aligned to their English harness splits (96.6-100% verified), minus the union of carve-outs.
  - S7_flores_devtest.
  Every translated row has automated QC: cross-family back-translation chrF++ (gemini-2.5-flash for gpt-4.1 outputs, gpt-4.1-mini for gemini/pod outputs, MADLAD only where those failed), LaBSE, GlotLID, length ratio, qc_pass, and an instability flag against an independent alternate translation (gpt-4.1 for S3; MADLAD elsewhere). Native review is PENDING (250-row blinded packet).

title: Bilingual safety test of four model versions
summary: |-
  C1 BEHAVIOUR, the FINAL behavioural evaluation, executed once against a protocol and prompt sample frozen and hashed before any model output existed. 4,800 greedy 256-token generations: 5 checkpoints (gams_orig, gams_edit=Heretic LoRA trial 88, gemma_orig, gemma_edit=trial 96, plus community_ref p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic as a SANITY REFERENCE) x 960 prompts (S5 = 280 RefusEU row_ids x EN+SL; S5X = 100 verified EN-SL translation pairs, the ONLY paired cross-language basis; S6 = 150 XSTest-safe x EN+SL). Each edit and its original share one NF4 base load (adapter enabled vs disable_adapter()), the same frozen bucket batch schedule and the same blinded judge.

  RESULTS (every number re-derived twice by independent code paths: audit.py 127/127, verify_headlines.py 173/173, 0 mismatches, placebos correct).
  1. Suppression, without breakage: GaMS3 EN refusal .986->.014, SL .871->.000; Gemma-3 EN .971->.287, SL .939->.739 (all Holm p<1e-14). Invalid rate is 0.000 in EVERY cell and SL language consistency moves <=0.4 points, so neither edit buys suppression with incoherence. Over-refusal on XSTest-safe also falls (GaMS3 .100->.000 EN; Gemma-3 .327->.193 SL). Official-guard ASR: GaMS3 edit .982 EN / .972 SL; Gemma-3 edit .738 EN / .103 SL.
  2. HEADLINE: on the 100 paired translations the English-derived edit transfers to Slovene in GaMS3 but not in Gemma-3 - residual SL-EN refusal gap +.69 [.60,.78], McNemar p=3.4e-21 for gemma_edit vs ~0 for gams_edit and both originals; DiD +.66 [.55,.76] vs +.01 [-.03,.05]. The sign holds in BOTH translation directions, so it is not translationese.
  3. NOT intrinsic to Gemma-3: the community bf16 edit of the same base shows a gap of only +.12 [.05,.20]. What differs is achieved optimisation strength, not architecture.
  4. MEASUREMENT FINDING (likely mechanism for 3): Heretic's own keyword proxy is near-exact on the ORIGINALS (false-positive share .015-.031) but collapses on the edits - gemma_edit EN keyword-refusal .851 vs judged .255, i.e. 76% false positives, kappa -.04. Gemma's compliances are caveat-laden and keep firing the markers, and gemma_edit EN refusals become PARTIAL compliance (.548), so an optimiser scored by that proxy loses gradient.
  5. NEGATIVE (supplementary): R_seq refusal readout pooled Spearman .86/.84 (GaMS3) but .63/.48 (Gemma-3), collapsing to .16-.33 within edit checkpoints alone - most apparent validity is the orig-vs-edit contrast.

  JUDGING / LIMITS. The run-level OpenRouter budget blocked gpt-4.1 at 716/3,840 core items (seeded-random shuffled order, so a random subset). Per fallback F1 a substitute judge from a third family, Qwen3-14B run locally, applies the SAME frozen rubric to all 4,800 items; it agrees with gpt-4.1 at kappa .83 (6-way CLASS) and .91 (refused-vs-not). Its safe/unsafe line tracks the REQUEST (it marks 77% of gemma_edit EN refusals unsafe), so ASR comes from RefusEU's official pipeline (Llama-Guard-3-8B + PolyGuard-Qwen, 91.2% agreement, full reproduction; 292 unadjudicated disagreements are BOUNDED, not dropped); its LANG line fails on short Slovene refusals, so language consistency is GlotLID (100% agreement with gpt-4.1 on the overlap). Gemini second judge and the gpt-4o-mini adjudicator were not run (same budget block); native review is PENDING; a 30-item blind EXECUTOR CHECK gives kappa .67 5-way / .93 refused-vs-not. B3 batching certification FAILED as designed (GaMS3 failed even unpadded exact-length buckets, so part of the batch-vs-single drift is NF4 numerics, not padding); buckets with one shared schedule were used for all five checkpoints. Nothing is attributed to a training stage (n=2 models, one optimisation seed); S5 EN-vs-SL is UNPAIRED; absolute levels are NF4- and 256-token-specific. API spend $1.07.

title: Utility cost and inner harm signal after abliteration
summary: >-
  Four checkpoints (GaMS3-12B-Instruct and gemma-3-12b-it originals + iteration-1 Heretic LoRA edits, trials 88/96), EN and
  SL, NF4, one code path. BEHAVIOUR (gpt-4.1, random ~52% of S4 harmful gens; run budget exhausted): GaMS edit refused 100->5.6%
  EN / 6.7% SL; Gemma edit 99->70.3% EN / 95.3% SL (English-derived edit transfers fully in GaMS, barely in Gemma although
  Gemma's EN/SL harm-direction cosine is higher, 0.92 vs 0.83). Marker rule badly undercounts Gemma refusals (32.7% vs 70.3%).
  Second free judge (nemotron-3-ultra) kappa vs gpt-4.1 0.83 (refused) / 0.77 (6-way). UTILITY: 6 tasks x 250 frozen items
  x EN/SL, harness-replica scorer validated vs lm-eval (strings 100% identical, flag agreement 98.7/99.5%; ll bar fails only
  via harness bf16 rounding): macro change +0.13/+0.20 (GaMS EN/SL), +0.13/0.00 (Gemma), Holm p=1; all task deltas within
  1.6 pts; FLORES dNLL <=0.002; no wrong-language/empty/malformed outputs; Gemma EN first-token KL uninformative (255/257
  'Okay,'). MECHANISM: harm linearly decodable (held-out S4 AUROC >=0.996, not lexical/length). GaMS: frozen original probe
  collapses (0.998->0.60 EN/0.42 SL at L34, min 0.20 at L27) while refit stays 0.985/0.954; 71-73% of harm mean-difference
  energy on the frozen axis removed to ~0.1%, complement AUROC 0.985/0.955 -> re-encoding, not information loss. Gemma: frozen-axis
  separation halves equally in EN and SL from L28, yet behaviour changes only in EN -> axis compression does not explain the
  language asymmetry; late-layer axis rotation differs (cos 0.53 EN vs 0.83 SL). A2 (pre-registered): GaMS R_seq passes gate;
  slope ratio 0.36 EN / 0.42 SL -> EVIDENCE_LOSS label = decoupling of refusal from the ORIGINAL evidence axis while information
  stays decodable (changed mapping). Gemma R_seq fails gate EN; judged logistic also EVIDENCE_LOSS (flagged separation artefact).
  Gemma flips hit low-evidence items first (criterion-shift signature). EXPLORATORY dose-response (LoRA x f): Gemma SL needs
  ~2x edit strength (R_seq>0 harmful SL 98.8/77.4/46.3/7.0% at f=1/1.5/2/3 vs EN 90.3/45.1/24.5/12.8%); GaMS EN/SL move together.
  Bonus GaMS3-12B base: harm decodable (CV AUROC 0.99/0.96), complies with most harmful QA prompts. Outputs: method_out.json
  (8056 examples: S4 per item x lang x role with responses, labels, R_seq/R1, s_i, KL; S7 utility per item), results/analysis/tables.md
  + summary.json, per-item parquets, S5/S5X projections, r_prior npz, figures fig1-fig8, blinded review packet (PENDING).
  Audits: verify_numbers 80/80, audit_headline raw re-derivation identical with failing placebos. Caveats: n=2 models, one
  Heretic run each, NF4, MT Slovene, partial judge coverage.

summary: >-
  P1 random-edit panel on cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct@1d0b27af (bnb_4bit NF4, Heretic 3521f864, default LoRA operator). 246 Heretic
  edits (E0 = journal trials 0-59, E_TPE = trials 60-115 incl. core trial 88, E1 = 100 prior draws seed 20260925, E_R = 30
  draws seed 20260924; E0/E1/E_R certified identical to the sibling Gemma pod) were rebuilt through Heretic's own reset_model+abliterate
  and scored in EN and SL on teacher-forced traits over S3 DEV halves A/B: R_seq, R1, Rb (JBB 85 twins), K = log mean truncated
  KL on Dolly continuations (100), N = FLORES NLL rise (200), M = MC margin change (120). Question: are EN traits (all Heretic's
  optimiser sees) a sufficient surrogate for SL? Gap_t = R2*(EN_A->EN_B) - R2*(EN_A->SL_B), noise-ceiling normalised, joint
  edit x item bootstrap B=1000, protocol frozen+hashed before any trait. RESULTS (F = 160 fitted edits, primary learner HistGBT):
  refusal proxy R_seq passes the judged validity gate (Spearman EN 0.970, SL 0.910 over 18 conditions). Claim 1 holds (confirmatory):
  Gap_R = 0.015, 90% CI [0.008, 0.027]: EN predicts SL refusal as well as EN. Main hypothesis G3 SUPPORTED for K only (confirmatory):
  Gap_K = 0.147 [0.074, 0.265], Holm p~0, MDE 0.137, SIMEX 0.112, margin-matched 0.131, halves 0.118/0.150, B_K 0.050 [0.001,
  0.121]; reverse direction -0.124 (language-specific K component). SL KL is smaller on average (mean-change ratio 0.59) but
  EN traits cannot rank which edits hurt SL. N and M: F8 'no signal to predict' (no automatic language damage visible). Frozen
  exposure carrier D FAILS (G4; dR2 for K -0.011 [-0.058, 0.027]); exploratory post-freeze lead: refusal-direction SOURCE
  LAYER explains the SL/EN KL ratio (Spearman 0.77; dR2 0.047 [0.008, 0.074] over EN traits + static baselines). Gap_Heretic_K
  on journal trials only 0.018 (boundary). Forecast coverage fails on E_TPE for several traits (G6 false). r_prior defined
  (G5 false). Bilingual reselection keeps trial 88 (SL_est 1.1). Independent re-derivation (rederive_headlines.py, different
  learners): Gap_K 0.115/0.105, Gap_R ~0.01, validity and kappa exact; all placebos fail. Judging: gpt-4.1 labelled 1130/2140
  generations ($1.06) before the run-level OpenRouter budget ran out; the remaining 1010 and the second-judge role use a local
  Qwen3-14B (kappa vs gpt-4.1 0.875 refused-vs-not, n=1130); gemini second judge not run. Cross-GPU repro: traits re-score

title: English edits barely unlock Slovene refusal in Gemma
summary: >-
  Gemma-3-12b-it (NF4, Heretic 3521f864) random-edit panel testing whether English refusal/utility traits predict Slovene.
  203 edits scored teacher-forced in EN+SL on frozen S3 DEV halves: E0 = 60 journal startup trials (same vectors as the GaMS
  pod), E1 = 103 fresh prior draws (seed 20260925), E_TPE = trial 96 + last 40 TPE trials (held out). Fitted set 163 non-collapsed
  (>=150 floor met). Traits R_seq, R1, Rb, K, N, M; covariates P (r_prior), H (d_EN), D, b1/b2/b3, Omega. Validity: 14 edits
  judged by a LOCAL judge (original gemma, frozen gpt-4.1 rubric; 98.2% binary agreement with gpt-4.1 on 440 original generations);
  API blocked by the run budget. R* = R1 (Spearman EN .892 / SL .853). KEY RESULTS: (1) Slovene refusal is strongly attenuated:
  SL/EN transfer slope R1 0.436, R_seq 0.220. Core edit trial 96: judged harmful refusal EN 36->10/41, SL 41->39/41; no validity
  edit brought SL below 30/41. The attenuation survives margin matching (slope 0.558) and the mixed model (sl:x -0.321). (2)
  Teacher-forced, edits raise compliance log-prob equally in both languages (slope 0.849) but lower the refusal-opener log-prob
  only in English (slope 0.081). (3) The attenuated response is predictable from English: R2 EN_A->SL_B 0.94 vs EN_B 0.99;
  Gap_R1 +0.054 [0.022, 0.128] (<0.10 -> P-a NOT CONFIRMED; within a label-swap placebo range); margin-matched +0.057 (P-d
  NOT CONFIRMED); Gap_Rb +0.018 (P-b UNTESTABLE, Rb fails the SL gate); Gap_K +0.079 (Holm p .009); N and M unreliable in
  SL. (4) Carrier: r_prior removal P adds dR2 +0.004 over geometry baselines, which themselves have CV R2<=0 (P-c NOT CONFIRMED);
  exploratory H adds nothing. (5) No journal trial has predicted SL judged refusal <= 0.20 (best 0.57). Audit (independent
  numpy path) and rederive.py (raw files, polynomial OLS: Gap_R1 +0.052; slopes and judged counts match exactly) pass, with
  placebos failing as expected. Outputs: method_out.json (per-edit rows + all analysis tables), results/analysis.json, results/verdicts.json,
  results/panel/*.parquet, results/validity/, figures fig1-6, README.md, reproducibility.md. Caveats: correlational carrier;

title: Why an English safety edit misses Slovene
summary: >-
  Iteration-2 causal test in google/gemma-3-12b-it (NF4 4-bit, pinned 96b6f1ec), with cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct as a descriptive
  contrast and p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic@e037e6e1 as a held-out community edit. Question: is the Slovene refusal that survives
  an English refusal-direction ablation (d_EN, A1 frozen site L20) carried by a harm-orthogonal, language-conditioned refusal
  prior r_prior (Wang et al. 2025 false-refusal construction from judged harmless refusals)? Directions, layer and strengths
  were chosen on S3 half A and frozen (configs/FREEZE.sha256) before the OUTCOME set (41 JBB half-B + 70 StrongREJECT held-out-category
  twin pairs, EN+SL; 111 harmful + 111 harmless per language) was touched. 12,136 greedy generations; blind batched gpt-4.1
  judge (5,298 labels, every frozen-prediction arm fully covered; $3.43, run budget then exhausted), local Qwen3-14B second
  judge on every generation (kappa 0.77 refused-vs-not). RESULTS: the pre-registered hypothesis FAILS. d_EN leaves 0.86 SL
  harmful refusal (EN 0.23); adding r_prior at matched EN efficacy cuts it by only 0.036 [-0.037, 0.109], below the best energy+collateral-matched
  random (0.074) and the shuffled-label control (0.135): KILL (a) and (c) fire; F1/F3/F4/F6 fail, F2 passes, F5 is not evaluable
  (community SL hoc refusal 0.26 < 0.40). r_prior is language-dominated (cos with the language axis 0.65, with its shuffled-label
  twin 0.89); d_EN+l cuts 0.315 but costs +1.93 nats of SL FLORES NLL. r_prior alone gives a real but sub-threshold drop in
  SL over-refusal (0.28 to 0.19, Holm p 0.025). EXPLORATORY discovery (declared post-freeze): ablating each layer's own d_EN(h)
  at all 48 layers removes the SL residual (0.86 to 0.10, gpt-4.1 partial coverage; 0.91 to 0.23 second judge) with fluent
  Slovene (FLORES +0.52), whereas layer-matched random (0.86) and energy-matched PC (0.93) controls do nothing, and no single
  12-layer band suffices (cumulative through layers 1-36): the residual is written redundantly across depth, not missing a
  direction. The same move repairs the core Heretic edit (SL hoc 0.93 to 0.11; its random control 0.47). The core iteration-1
  edit is optimisation-limited (SL hoc 0.89 vs community 0.26). GaMS3 shows no SL-specific residual. Frozen harm probe still
  decodes harmfulness after ablation; cosine-based transfer prediction fails at item level (AUROC 0.24). All numbers re-derived
  by verify_numbers.py (103/103) and independently from raw files by audit_headline.py (43/43, placebos null). Files: method_out.json

title: How deep must an edit go to stop Slovene refusal
summary: |-
  Coverage x strength factorial on Heretic-family weight edits in google/gemma-3-12b-it (NF4), asking whether Slovene refusal survives an English-derived edit because the edit is not DEEP enough. 122 cells, 27,784 generations, all judged by a partial-aware 4-way scorer (local Qwen3-14B on iteration-2 exp4's frozen rubric verbatim; REFUSED/PARTIAL/COMPLIED/INVALID, PARTIAL counted as compliance and shown separately, INVALID never refusal), certified at kappa = 0.866 refused-vs-not against a bought 600-item gpt-4.1 subsample on THIS run's own edited cells (on-disk pools gave 0.779, below the 0.80 bar, so the subsample was bought as the plan prescribes; $0.70 of a $10 cap).

  WHAT FAILED (pre-registered, with its own falsifier firing). P1: coverage descriptors add dR2 = 0.040 [0.006, 0.136] over log-energy + the English effect + static geometry baselines, but leave-one-out dR2 = -0.002, partial F p = 0.17, and a permutation placebo yields a LARGER dR2 on average (p95 0.158); MDE = 0.071 < the 0.10 bar, so this is a powered rejection. P2: pooled matched-energy contrast +0.049 [-0.000, 0.098], inside its label-swap placebo, signs disagreeing across the four groups, and the coverage x language interaction runs BACKWARDS (DiD -0.120 [-0.214, -0.033]); held-out harm categories replicate this. Both fail Holm.

  WHAT SURVIVED, each placebo-tested. P3: the DEV-frozen depth index predicts per-cell residuals out of sample, Spearman 0.78 in both languages (permutation null [-0.27, 0.29]); 97% of cells covering fewer than index_SL = 20 effective layers leave Slovene above 0.5, but only 47% at/above it fall below, so the index is NECESSARY not sufficient. The mechanism is band DENSITY, not breadth: lowest reachable Slovene refusal is monotone in the fraction of layers 13-24 covered (12/12 -> 0.024-0.171; 6/12 -> 0.732; 3/12 -> 0.927; 0/12 -> 0.951-1.000), Spearman -0.942, permutation p = 0.0038. At identical energy (E = 19.2), 12 contiguous mid-depth layers reach SL 0.63 while 24 layers strided over the full depth leave 0.98. Leave-one-band-out: sparing layers 25-36 costs Slovene +0.39 residual refusal and English 0.00. An independent activation read converges: Slovene's harm-write mass is 60% in 25-36 where English's is 63% in 37-48.

  CROSS-LANGUAGE CLAIM, CORRECTLY BOUNDED. index_EN = 16 vs index_SL = 20 is directionally as pre-registered, but 4 layers is one k-grid step and sits INSIDE its language-permutation null [-4, +4] - the index alone does not carry it. The powered statistic is the prefix-curve separation: +0.080 [0.021, 0.136], permutation p = 0.0065.

  PRACTICAL. Heretic's own kernel support at c = 1.5 reaches SL 0.024 / EN 0.049 harmful refusal at FLORES dNLL -0.000 nats, KL 0.030, 0% invalid, 99.2% Slovene (screen), and SL 0.08 / EN 0.02 on 100 VERIFIED RefusEU translation pairs (vs unedited 0.98/0.91). The frozen-subset kernel at x1 cuts Slovene over-refusal on XSTest-safe from 0.37 to 0.08 at utility cost indistinguishable from zero. Iteration 2's activation repair reaches lower Slovene refusal but costs +0.589 nats and a real English capability hit (-0.053 [-0.083, -0.023] S7 macro). Both matched controls (write-space random, energy-matched harmless PC; energy matched within 10% AND collateral matched, 8/8 accepted) are null at SL 0.95-1.00.

  REUSABLE FOR LATER ROUNDS (absolute paths in README.md): results/gens/ (all 27,784 generations, 122 cells), results/cells/ (coefficient profiles, closed-form edit energies, FLORES/KL, control-draw diagnostics, S7 utility), results/cells.csv, results/per_item.parquet, results/judge_local.jsonl + judge_api.jsonl, the frozen redundancy_index.json / frozen_predictions.json / FREEZE.sha256, report_tables.md, and 6 figures. Verification: rederive.py re-derives 318/318 headline numbers through a stdlib+numpy path importing nothing from the repo; audit_positive.py placebo-tests every surviving positive claim and is what demoted the index statistic and corrected the band claim from "contains" to "covers densely". 13 deviations recorded. Native Slovene review remains PENDING; one model, one seed, NF4 only.

title: Where to cut refusal in a bilingual model
summary: |-
  GaMS3-12B-Instruct half of the iteration-3 depth-coverage test. 57 cells, 10,690 judged generations, $0.00 OpenRouter spend (the run key was exhausted; judging is the local Qwen3-14B with iteration-2's frozen rubric).

  PART A (DEV only, S3 JBB half A, 40 harmful+40 harmless per language). Cumulative-prefix / suffix / leave-one-band-out ablation of the FROZEN per-layer English refusal directions d_EN(h) reused from art_hmbXDppkPZnR (cos>=0.9964 vs a fresh recompute at every h). index_EN=16 [16,16], index_SL=20 [16,24], difference 4 [0,8] -> PA1 EQUIVALENT_WITHIN_MARGIN against the pre-declared +/-8 margin (Holm p 0.069). CRITICAL CAVEAT: the co-primary USABLE index (refusal<0.5 AND INVALID<=0.10) is '>48' in BOTH languages - activation-space depth coverage only removes refusal by destroying the model (INVALID 0.72 EN / 0.38 SL at the crossing, FLORES +1.4 nats).

  PART B (the decisive panel). Heretic's own abliterate() generalised to arbitrary per-(layer,component) weights (heretic_op.py; operator-equivalence vs Heretic's own source max rel err 1.7e-06; trial-88 adapter rebuild median 3.3e-07; energy identity <1e-06). 3 matched-total-removal-energy groups (E*=6.9/13.9/27.8, every member within 2%), each with narrow bands B2/B3, spread sets STR4/STR2/ALL, plus no-op, layer-matched RANDOM and energy-matched PC controls; anchors G1 single-site, CORE trial-88 adapter, SWAP_in (Gemma trial-96 kernel); plus a 10-cell coverage grid at c=1.

  HEADLINE RESULTS (confirmation = S4 held-out Llama-Guard categories, 70 pairs/language, frozen BEFORE generation; freeze mtime precedes all 25 confirmation files):
  - PB2 FALSIFIED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION: narrow-and-strong minus broad-and-weak SL refusal = -0.10 [-0.150,-0.060]; CONCENTRATING the same energy on one 12-layer band beats spreading it (Holm p 0.000).
  - PB3 FALSIFIED OPPOSITE: coverage x language interaction -0.07 [-0.131,-0.007]; the advantage of concentrating is LARGER in Slovene.
  - Placement at matched energy AND matched layer count (12 contiguous vs every 4th): SL 0.24 vs 0.81 (E3), 0.51 vs 0.89 (E2), 0.83 vs 0.93 (E1), every CI excluding 0.
  - PB1 NOT SUPPORTED: coverage dR2 = 0.002 [0.000,0.010] over 26 cells; leave-one-cell-out dR2 = -0.043. Nested decomposition: log E alone R2 0.325 -> +WHERE the energy sits (band fractions) 0.718 -> +HOW MANY layers 0.400. Placement, not coverage count, carries the variance.
  - PB4 NOT SUPPORTED (Spearman 0.21): a count-based index cannot express placement (it gives a 12-layer band and 12 spread layers the same prediction).
  - Band profile at c=1 (SL): layers 1-12 0.93, 13-24 0.24, 25-36 0.02, 37-48 0.85.
  - Controls null everywhere: random / PC at matched energy leave SL refusal 0.93-0.95 (screen) vs no-op 0.93.
  - OPERATOR MATTERS MORE THAN DEPTH: the same directions as Heretic's row-norm-preserving weight edit remove refusal at ~zero collateral (|SL FLORES dNLL| <= 0.011, MC accuracy within 0.031 of no-op, INVALID ~0.01), while the raw activation projection of those same directions breaks the model.
  - CROSS-MODEL (descriptive, n=2): the sibling iteration-3 Gemma pod independently reports index_EN=16 / index_SL=20 - identical to GaMS3. The Slovene lag is common to both checkpoints, so it is NOT what distinguishes them; no difference is attributed to any training stage.

  AUDIT: rederive.py re-derives 481/481 headline numbers (228 per-cell rates, 24 prefix points, 2 indices, PB1/PB2/PB3/PB4, the nested R2 decomposition, 218 exact McNemar tests) from the raw per-generation files through a code path importing nothing from the analysis; freeze-order check PASS; three placebos collapse (cell-label-within-item 0.003, language-label -0.001, energy-shuffled 0.023) against real effects of -0.105 and -0.071.

  JUDGE LIMITATION: on-disk certification vs gpt-4.1 gives kappa 0.86 Slovene but 0.54 English within EDITED arms (paid top-up impossible, HTTP 403), so English rates are the strict end of a judge range; PARTIAL is always its own column. GaMS3's shipped edit already left only 0.10 SL refusal, so this panel measures trade-offs, not a rescue. S5/S6/S7 never opened; ASR and the lm-eval macro not run (deviations.json, 9 entries).

  OUTPUT LAYOUT: method_out.json IS the comparison table - 462 examples (one per split x item x language) x 56 distinct predict_<method> fields = 10,690 per-item outcomes, exactly the 10,690 generations produced. `output` is the UNEDITED model's 4-way class; each predict_<method> is the class the same item got under one intervention that ran (band edits, matched-energy spread edits, random/PC controls, prefix/suffix/LOBO activation arms, single-site ablation, shipped Heretic edit, Gemma kernel swap), with its text, gpt-4.1 label, rule label and GlotLID language in metadata_*. Headline recomputes from this file alone: SL narrow-broad -0.1048 over n=70; controls null at 0.957 vs 0.957 baseline.

title: Heretic's refusal counter misjudges its own edits
summary: |-
  C3: replaces Heretic's 33-substring keyword refusal counter with a judge-distilled, partial-aware classifier, holding the Heretic commit, seed, search space, construction data, NF4 quantisation, 116-trial budget, KL scorer and the frozen selection rule fixed, on google/gemma-3-12b-it in English and Slovene.

  CLEAN POSITIVE (the finding). All 116 iteration-1 parameter draws were re-scored inside Heretic's own loop and all 11,600 in-loop generations were labelled with the frozen art_m6pglf516e2r rubric (Qwen3-14B). The keyword objective reaches only kappa +0.196 against the judge, reports .907 refusal where the judge sees .711, and 25.4% of its 'refusals' are false; the distilled classifier reaches +0.924. The counter never falls below 72/100 across all 116 draws while judged refusal spans 7-98/100, so the optimiser is blind exactly where its candidates differ; on the keyword-selected trial 96 it reports 74/100 where the judge sees 37 refusals and 49 PARTIAL answers. Mean absolute error in a draw's refusal count: 30.6/100 (keyword) vs 2.1/100 (classifier). This is a SELECTION failure on the optimiser's own candidates, not evaluation noise.

  INSTRUMENT. The classifier (char/word TF-IDF + hand features, logistic regression, first 100 tokens = the in-loop view) is distilled from 11,885 prior judge labels and certified only on 20 held-out replayed trials: kappa .858 [.820,.888] vs the keyword rule's .143. The base fit missed the pre-registered 0.80 bar (.729) and was refit once, as planned, on non-certification trials. It is a drop-in Heretic Scorer plugin (third_party/heretic/src/heretic/scorers/partial_aware_refusal.py), not a fork.

  SELECTION CHANGES, REPLICATED. With the corrected objective the frozen rule fires its primary branch (min KL s.t. <=10/100 refusals), which the keyword run never could: trial 7, per-layer kernel, aligned coverage A1=64.0 vs trial 96's 26.0. A second optimiser seed (20260926) replicates: same rule branch, 5/100, A1=65.1. The shared first-60 seeded draws give a within-run A/B (8 vs 14 Pareto points).

  BEHAVIOUR AND THE FALSIFIER. Eight arms (original, keyword-selected, corrected, two reselections, dose ladder f=1.5/2/3) over 3,680 generations on 100 verified EN/SL pairs, 70 held-out-category StrongREJECT prompts, 60 XSTest-safe items and FLORES. Corrected cuts English judged refusal .15->.03 and the paired SL-EN gap +.68->+.38 [-.41,-.18 vs keyword]. BUT the pre-registered falsifier P7 fired: at equal English refusal the 1.5x-scaled old edit has gap +.33 (-.05 [-.41,+.12]), and at equal harmless KL the ladder reaches gap .00 (-.38 [-.47,-.29]) - dose for dose the corrected edit is strictly worse. Mechanism is DOSE, not placement. P2 also failed. Post-hoc reselection (seed-free) recovers the whole effect, so the change is mis-scoring of trials already held, not a different search. Official RefusEU guard ASR moves the same way; invalid output .000 everywhere, GlotLID >= .991, Slovene FLORES dNLL <= +.005 for selected arms.

  VERIFIED: audit_headline.py 305/305 and audit_extra.py 17/17 re-derive every headline from raw files by different code paths, with 7 placebos that all fail as required; verify_numbers.py 59/59. Kept for later rounds: adapters_corrected/ (the corrected LoRA), checkpoints/ (both Optuna journals), scorer/refusal_clf.joblib.

  LIMITS: one model; behavioural arms from one seed; no frontier judge validated any new label (run-level OpenRouter budget was exhausted at the first call, $0.00 spent) so the workhorse judge's within-edited agreement with gpt-4.1 (kappa .78) bounds every judged number; lm-eval utility cut before generation; Slovene is machine-translated with native review pending; NF4-specific levels; greedy decoding is not bit-reproducible across GPU models.

title: Depth index fails to predict cross-lingual refusal-edit failure
summary: >-
  Iteration-3 predictive test in google/gemma-3-12b-it (anchor, NF4, pinned 96b6f1ec), Qwen/Qwen3-8B and mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
  (EuroLLM-9B-Instruct was the planned M3 but is gated and returned HTTP 403; the recorded fallback order was followed, results/load_log.json),
  in EN/SL plus DE/LT newly translated with NLLB-200-distilled-1.3B. QUESTION: can iteration-2's depth-redundancy observation
  be turned into a PREDICTIVE instrument? A per-language index (smallest cumulative depth coverage of d_EN(h) activation ablation
  at which judged harmful refusal falls below 0.5, measured on DEV-only S3 JBB half-B items) was computed, FROZEN and hashed
  (configs/frozen_predictions.json in configs/FREEZE.sha256; run_model.py --phase conf raises without it) BEFORE any confirmation
  generation, then tested out of sample on 60 held-out StrongREJECT harmful items per language (30 held-out-category + 30
  in-distribution, paired by semantic id) against English-derived Heretic-operator WEIGHT edits (Heretic 3521f864's projected,
  row-norm-preserving rank-3 LoRA with OUR per-layer directions injected): W0 no-op, W1 narrow 25%-depth band, W2 energy-matched
  all-depth stride, W3 selected kernel (Gemma = the REAL iteration-1 trial-96 adapter, sha256-verified), W4 energy- AND collateral-matched
  random. RESULT: the pre-registered claim is FALSIFIED. P1 pooled Spearman(index, residual refusal) = -0.009 [-0.131, 0.192]
  over 21 rows (permutation p 0.16); the AUC secondary gives +0.167; P2 concordance 8/12 decided (0.67, below the 0.75 bar,
  and 6/12 under judge-error correction); P3 alone holds in sign (Spearman(index, W2-W1) = -0.474). CRITICALLY, EN/L direction
  cosine ALSO fails (+0.010), so the 'familiar geometry stops predicting' boundary is real but stops for our index too, while
  two CHEAP baselines beat both by margins whose paired item-bootstrap CIs exclude zero: single-site transfer rho +0.732 (index-baseline
  -0.741 [-0.810, -0.528]) and the unedited model's baseline refusal in that language rho +0.661 (-0.670 [-0.721, -0.497]).
  Gemma's real trial-96 adapter on held-out items leaves EN 0.60 / DE 0.53 / LT 0.75 / SL 0.92 from a 0.93-0.98 no-op, replicating
  the iteration-1/2 English-Slovene asymmetry on a new harm source and extending it to two new languages; its energy- and
  collateral-matched random control leaves SL at 0.98, and the SL-NLLB vs SL-gpt translation-method control moves every rate
  by <=0.09, closing that confound. POST-HOC (exploratory, changes no verdict, prompted by the language-shuffle placebo returning
  -0.356 instead of ~0): within the anchor model the index DOES order the languages (rho +0.678) but Qwen3's eligible languages
  all share one index value so it has zero variance there; pooled within-model-centred rho is +0.458 (AUC +0.620), and cosine
  REVERSES sign between models (-0.748 gemma, +0.556 qwen3). The frozen eligibility gate did real work pre-hoc: Mistral refuses
  only 0.07-0.53 at baseline (0.07 in Lithuanian) so all four of its rows were excluded before any confirmation data existed,
  and it was dropped from the weight panel under the pre-registered cut order rather than swapped silently. AUDIT: rederive.py
  (stdlib+numpy only, reading only raw generations, labels and the frozen file) reproduces every index, AUC, eligibility flag,
  residual and P1-P4 statistic: 102 checks, 0 mismatches; placebos (b) index permutation -0.009, (c) label swap flips sign,
  (d) DEV-as-CONF correctly flagged LEAKAGE. Positive control 4/4: the Gemma DEV curve reproduces iteration-2's anchor (EN
  P50 0.39 vs 0.42, SL P75 0.27 vs 0.21). JUDGE LIMITATION, reported not buried: the run's OpenRouter budget was exhausted
  before this artifact began ($0.00 spent here), so gpt-4.1 was unavailable and the planned fallback could not fire; the local
  Qwen3-14B judge (rubric variant chosen on a DEV split of the free existing gpt-4.1 label pool, certified once on a disjoint
  holdout) reaches kappa 0.683 [0.629, 0.737], BELOW its 0.80 gate, with Se 0.984 / Sp 0.741, so absolute refusal levels are
  biased upward and a Rogan-Gladen corrected re-run of P1/P2 is reported. analysis.py was patched after the freeze for numerical
  robustness only (empty-bootstrap quantile; undefined differences must not count as decided); both hashes and the full diff
  are in results/analysis_patch.json and checks.py flags analysis_py_unchanged=false. Native review PENDING. 9,199 blind 4-way

summary: >-
  CPU-only audit of the iteration-2 draft against raw per-item files of 7 artifacts (iter1 exp1/exp3; iter2 exp4-8), by an

  misdescribed, 6 untraceable (mismatch rate .055); 2 sign-reversed conclusions: (a) iter-1 swap: GaMS3 trial-88 params on
  Gemma give EN 100->53, SL 97->25 at KL .254 (draft '91/95 at .293' exists in no file); (b) exp7 P-a was frozen as 'Gap_R

title: Where a refusal edit lands decides what survives
summary: |-
  WHAT WAS RUN. A frozen, DEV-only causal write profile e_L(h) (judged refusal drop from ablating the frozen English refusal direction d_EN(h) at ONE hidden index, 44 JBB half-A items/language, 48 sites) defines an overlap instrument O_L(edit)=sum_h e_L(h)g(h)/||g|| over each Heretic-family weight edit's closed-form per-layer removal energy g(h). O is invariant to coefficient rescaling, so it measures placement only. O was frozen (hashed, mtime-checked) and tested out of sample on google/gemma-3-12b-it NF4: 29 conditions x 60 frozen held-out items/language (40 StrongREJECT held-out-category + 20 verified RefusEU EN-SL pairs). The conditions were 8 matched groups (high-O vs low-O windows at IDENTICAL closed-form energy and IDENTICAL layer count), energy-matched write-space random and harmless-PC controls, a dose ladder and a no-op. Outside family: Qwen3-8B (EN/SL/DE; LT excluded by the pre-registered gate), 3 matched groups + controls. 10,000 generations were judged 4-way (REFUSED/PARTIAL/COMPLIED/INVALID) by local Qwen3-14B on the frozen exp4 rubric; the gate used 800 gpt-4.1 labels ($0.97).

  RESULTS. (1) FROZEN VERDICT: FALSIFIED for the instrument claim. O's incremental R2 over the pre-declared nuisance stack is 0.026 EN (powered, MDE 0.047) and 0.052 SL (inconclusive band), below the 0.05 falsifier, because the g-weighted EN/SL direction cosine is collinear with O (rho 0.81/0.76; R2 alone 0.83/0.63 vs O 0.87/0.75). (2) PLACEMENT IS STRONGLY CONFIRMED. The high-O member leaves less refusal in 8/8 groups in both languages (pooled EN -0.69 [-0.75,-0.62], SL -0.38 [-0.46,-0.31]; best: layers 16-31 EN 0.07/SL 0.27 vs layers 33-48 0.92/0.92 at the same energy). Random/PC controls stay within +-0.03 of the no-op, and a 2x dose of the late-layer edit still leaves EN 0.88/SL 0.92. (3) O ranks the 18 held-out conditions near-perfectly: Spearman -0.96 EN, -0.83 SL. It beats the unedited refusal rate and the single-site transfer rate on pooled rows (aligned CI [0.28,0.65], [0.29,0.76]), beats the single-site peak probe in EN (+0.17 [0.14,0.23]) and ties it in SL. (4) The language-label placebo does NOT collapse (EN profile predicts SL residual at -0.94), so the language-specific claim is demoted: O works by locating a shared mid-depth band (argmax prediction band 13-24 passes). (5) Under the best-placed edit the EN/SL gap is a strict-vs-broad effect (strict 0.07 vs 0.27, broad 0.53 vs 0.53; ASR-by-rubric 0.93 vs 0.72). (6) Qwen3-8B replicates placement: 9/9 matched contrasts favour high-O (8/9 CIs exclude 0); Spearman(O) EN -0.76, SL -0.93, DE -0.84; the miss REVERSES there (EN retains more refusal than SL). (7) Screen on 46 exp9 cells: O -0.71/-0.60 but energy dominates (dR2 0.008/0.028). Post-hoc harmless KL is a strong competitor (exploratory).

  JUDGE CAVEATS. Within-edited kappa 0.818 pooled; EN 0.856 passes, SL 0.744 fails, so SL is JUDGE_SENSITIVE (Rogan-Gladen keeps the ranking and enlarges the contrasts). The Gate-2 INVALID probe failed (the judge never labels synthetic incoherence INVALID), so a deterministic validity guard was added before confirmation. Native review pending.

  AUDIT. rederive.py (stdlib+numpy, independent path): 209/209 checks pass, including shuffled-O and label-swapped placebos that fail as required. Files: results/analysis.json, report_tables.md, cell_table.csv, per_item.csv, gens/, judge_local.jsonl, judge_api.jsonl, configs/frozen_predictions.json, figures/fig1-6, deviations.json (18 deviations, 3 NOT RUN: utility panel, guard ASR, GaMS3 screen).

title: Where a refusal edit must land in a Slovene model
summary: |-
  Iteration-4 slot-2 pod, cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct (NF4), 12,024 judged generations, 44 cells, $0.00 OpenRouter spend.

  WHAT IT BUILT. A per-language CAUSAL WRITE PROFILE e_L(h): the judged drop in harmful refusal from applying Heretic's own abliteration operator at ONE decoder layer with the frozen d_EN(h), measured on DEV items only (40 harmful per language). A pre-freeze pilot on DEV showed a single layer at Heretic's own bound moves almost nothing (max drop 0.05 at c=1, 0.10 at c=1.5), so the profile was measured at c=2.5 (max drop 0.65, zero degenerate output) - recorded as deviation D1. The profile peaks sharply at hidden index 27 in both languages; band mass EN 0.00/1.05/1.50/0.27 and SL 0.02/0.55/0.57/0.05 over bands 1-12/13-24/25-36/37-48. Split-half reliability is 0.812 (EN) but 0.312 (SL), so by the pre-registered rule the SLOVENE PROFILE IS DECLARED UNRELIABLE and its argmax prediction demoted to exploratory BEFORE the freeze. Frozen into O = sum_h e_L(h) g(h)/||g||_2 with 28 cell specifications, predicted O and rank, the named band and the thresholds, hashed into configs/FREEZE.sha256; the confirmation entry point raises without it (proved adversarially in results/gate_freeze.json).

  WHAT SURVIVED OUT OF SAMPLE (verdict PARTIAL, pre-registered ladder). Over 20 matched-energy confirmation cells (12 edited layers each, energy matched within 0.6%, 70 held-out-category StrongREJECT pairs per language) Spearman(O_SL, surviving Slovene strict refusal) = -0.903, CI [-0.928,-0.857], permutation p<0.001; within each energy level separately -0.967 (E2) and -0.948 (E3). Nested over log removal energy: dR2 0.580, leave-one-cell-out 0.594. O beats log energy (-0.384), depth span (-0.039) and mean depth (-0.328) with paired-bootstrap CIs excluding zero. All six controls (3 layer-matched random, 3 energy-matched PC draws, energy matched to 0.03%, collateral inside the real cells' range) are null: |dSL| <= 0.03 against a no-op of 0.957.

  THE THREE BOUNDARIES THE PAPER MUST CARRY. (1) THE EXPENSIVE INSTRUMENT DOES NOT EARN ITS COST: the same overlap from a FOUR-number band profile (LOO dR2 0.845) and the purely geometric EN/SL cosine overlap (0.834) beat O's 0.594, and the same cell's English outcome predicts the Slovene one at rho 0.945 - indistinguishable from O. The 48-layer profile establishes THAT placement matters, not the cheapest way to measure it. (2) THE NAMED BAND LOST: the DEV argmax names 25-36, but at matched energy band 13-24 removes more judged Slovene refusal (0.30 vs 0.53 at E=27.8) - NAMED_AND_LOST at both levels. The reason is a metric flip: the 33-substring opener rule ranks 25-36 first, judged STRICT ranks 13-24 first, judged BROAD ranks 25-36 first; band 25-36 buys its opener-rule 'success' with PARTIAL responses (mean strict-minus-rule gap 0.182, max 0.514). (3) NOT CHECKPOINT-SPECIFIC ON THESE SCREENS: the GaMS3 profile predicts the sibling checkpoint's 50 weight cells at -0.442, no worse than its own panel's -0.278; both screens are weak because unmatched panels let dose swamp placement.

  PLACEMENT VS DOSE. The A1-A4 ladder (shipped edit, sibling kernel, and each rescaled to the other's energy) sits at the refusal floor: dose moves the outcome at fixed placement (-0.186 and -0.157, McNemar p 0.001/0.003) while placement does not at fixed dose (-0.029, 0.000). A declared POST-FREEZE exploratory pair at E=13.9/27.8 confirms the two production kernels are indistinguishable once dose is matched (d 0.071 and 0.029, CIs including zero) - both spread mass over the effective band.

  are more often guard-safe than EN (+.23 [.12,.35]): non-actionable rather than compliant. Flip analysis for Gemma: slope
  reduced but not collapsed (.50 EN, .34 SL), intercept -6.7/-5.3, refit AUROC .997, i.e. a criterion shift plus partial coupling
  loss while the information survives. GaMS3 is not estimable. NF4 vs bf16: weight error .093, yet the edit-energy profile
  cosine is .999998; 32-token KL .11/.09; bf16 behavioural paired gap +.60 [.40,.80] vs NF4 +.45 [.20,.70], so the effect
  is bounded, not closed. Paste-ready repairs R1-R10 with source paths (lint 0), including the iteration-1 section restored
  verbatim. The independent stdlib recompute of 102 iteration-3 numbers finds 4.9% [2.1,11.0] wrong; all placebos collapse.

title: Finding the closest prior work for two results
summary: >-
  Positioning artifact (web research only; no code, no GPU, no paid API, $0 spend) that gives both of this run's reportable
  results the neighbours the reviewer said they lacked. Deliverables in results/: a 30-row neighbour table (markdown + JSON,
  N1-N30) where every row carries a verbatim <=40-word quote with its locator, a URL, an access date (2026-09-24) and a verified
  flag; two paste-ready positioning paragraphs (positive and negative) each stating its own stopping point; a 30-row claims_to_position.csv
  in which no claim is left without either a neighbour id or an evidenced NO NEIGHBOUR FOUND; reconciliation_map.csv (claim
  id -> neighbour ids -> producing file path -> tag -> paper sections that must agree); a tagged ledger separating 14 FAILED
  HYPOTHESES (each with the number and direction that killed it) from 10 UNEXECUTED PROPOSALS (each with its reason); the
  canonical stopping-points block for verbatim reuse; the full search log; and scripts/self_check.py, which passes. KEY OUTCOMES
  FOR THE PAPER. (1) The inherited '2-3 middle layers' attribution is RESOLVED: the sentence does exist in arXiv 2607.02714
  SS3.2, but as that paper's own attribution to Arditi et al. - which was not found in Arditi et al. by full-text search -
  and 2607.02714 rejects it in the next sentence, having found uniform layer spread beats signal-norm-based selection by up
  to ~70pp. It must not be cited as a standing depth fact. (2) The positive's delta is NARROWED: effect-based site selection
  (Hase 2023; 2609.22135; 2606.00926) and language-specific safety depths (2609.22144; 2605.23036) are already published.
  What survives is the matched-total-energy AND matched-layer-count placement contrast, per language, with the effective region
  differing between two sibling checkpoints - no neighbour found running that construction. (3) The negative now has four
  partial neighbours (Hase 2023; 2606.00926; 2609.04721 on cosine unreliability; 2608.24988 on weight-edit geometry surviving
  behavioural reversion) and an EVIDENCED ABSENCE for the conjunction, with the eight queries behind it logged; the wording
  prescribed is 'not found by these queries'. (4) The selection-blindness finding must be positioned against AdvPrefix (2412.10321),
  not StrongREJECT: AdvPrefix owns objective misspecification inside an optimiser for prompt attacks, so this run's claim
  is the weight-edit instance quantified on the search's own candidate population. (5) Tooling state, dated 2026-09-24: Heretic's
  default scorer on master is still the 33-marker substring counter plus KL over an English prompt set, although a benchmark
  scorer (PR #444, merged Sep 3 2026) and dataset config selection (PR #445, merged Sep 5 2026) are merged, and the community
  multilingual set covers 9 languages with no Slovene. Every line is tagged OBSERVATION / INTERPRETATION / FAILED HYPOTHESIS
  / UNEXECUTED PROPOSAL, and every number about this run carries the path of the file that produced it.

title: Where a refusal edit lands decides what survives
summary: |-
  WHAT WAS RUN. A frozen, DEV-only causal write profile e_L(h) (judged refusal drop from ablating the frozen English refusal direction d_EN(h) at ONE hidden index, 44 JBB half-A items/language, 48 sites) defines an overlap instrument O_L(edit)=sum_h e_L(h)g(h)/||g|| over each Heretic-family weight edit's closed-form per-layer removal energy g(h). O is invariant to coefficient rescaling, so it measures placement only. O was frozen (hashed, mtime-checked) and tested out of sample on google/gemma-3-12b-it NF4: 29 conditions x 60 frozen held-out items/language (40 StrongREJECT held-out-category + 20 verified RefusEU EN-SL pairs). The conditions were 8 matched groups (high-O vs low-O windows at IDENTICAL closed-form energy and IDENTICAL layer count), energy-matched write-space random and harmless-PC controls, a dose ladder and a no-op. Outside family: Qwen3-8B (EN/SL/DE; LT excluded by the pre-registered gate), 3 matched groups + controls. 10,000 generations were judged 4-way (REFUSED/PARTIAL/COMPLIED/INVALID) by local Qwen3-14B on the frozen exp4 rubric; the gate used 800 gpt-4.1 labels ($0.97).

  RESULTS. (1) FROZEN VERDICT: FALSIFIED for the instrument claim. O's incremental R2 over the pre-declared nuisance stack is 0.026 EN (powered, MDE 0.047) and 0.052 SL (inconclusive band), below the 0.05 falsifier, because the g-weighted EN/SL direction cosine is collinear with O (rho 0.81/0.76; R2 alone 0.83/0.63 vs O 0.87/0.75). (2) PLACEMENT IS STRONGLY CONFIRMED. The high-O member leaves less refusal in 8/8 groups in both languages (pooled EN -0.69 [-0.75,-0.62], SL -0.38 [-0.46,-0.31]; best: layers 16-31 EN 0.07/SL 0.27 vs layers 33-48 0.92/0.92 at the same energy). Random/PC controls stay within +-0.03 of the no-op, and a 2x dose of the late-layer edit still leaves EN 0.88/SL 0.92. (3) O ranks the 18 held-out conditions near-perfectly: Spearman -0.96 EN, -0.83 SL. It beats the unedited refusal rate and the single-site transfer rate on pooled rows (aligned CI [0.28,0.65], [0.29,0.76]), beats the single-site peak probe in EN (+0.17 [0.14,0.23]) and ties it in SL. (4) The language-label placebo does NOT collapse (EN profile predicts SL residual at -0.94), so the language-specific claim is demoted: O works by locating a shared mid-depth band (argmax prediction band 13-24 passes). (5) Under the best-placed edit the EN/SL gap is a strict-vs-broad effect (strict 0.07 vs 0.27, broad 0.53 vs 0.53; ASR-by-rubric 0.93 vs 0.72). (6) Qwen3-8B replicates placement: 9/9 matched contrasts favour high-O (8/9 CIs exclude 0); Spearman(O) EN -0.76, SL -0.93, DE -0.84; the miss REVERSES there (EN retains more refusal than SL). (7) Screen on 46 exp9 cells: O -0.71/-0.60 but energy dominates (dR2 0.008/0.028). Post-hoc harmless KL is a strong competitor (exploratory).

  JUDGE CAVEATS. Within-edited kappa 0.818 pooled; EN 0.856 passes, SL 0.744 fails, so SL is JUDGE_SENSITIVE (Rogan-Gladen keeps the ranking and enlarges the contrasts). The Gate-2 INVALID probe failed (the judge never labels synthetic incoherence INVALID), so a deterministic validity guard was added before confirmation. Native review pending.

  AUDIT. rederive.py (stdlib+numpy, independent path): 209/209 checks pass, including shuffled-O and label-swapped placebos that fail as required. Files: results/analysis.json, report_tables.md, cell_table.csv, per_item.csv, gens/, judge_local.jsonl, judge_api.jsonl, configs/frozen_predictions.json, figures/fig1-6, deviations.json (18 deviations, 3 NOT RUN: utility panel, guard ASR, GaMS3 screen).

title: Where a refusal edit must land in a Slovene model
summary: |-
  Iteration-4 slot-2 pod, cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct (NF4), 12,024 judged generations, 44 cells, $0.00 OpenRouter spend.

  WHAT IT BUILT. A per-language CAUSAL WRITE PROFILE e_L(h): the judged drop in harmful refusal from applying Heretic's own abliteration operator at ONE decoder layer with the frozen d_EN(h), measured on DEV items only (40 harmful per language). A pre-freeze pilot on DEV showed a single layer at Heretic's own bound moves almost nothing (max drop 0.05 at c=1, 0.10 at c=1.5), so the profile was measured at c=2.5 (max drop 0.65, zero degenerate output) - recorded as deviation D1. The profile peaks sharply at hidden index 27 in both languages; band mass EN 0.00/1.05/1.50/0.27 and SL 0.02/0.55/0.57/0.05 over bands 1-12/13-24/25-36/37-48. Split-half reliability is 0.812 (EN) but 0.312 (SL), so by the pre-registered rule the SLOVENE PROFILE IS DECLARED UNRELIABLE and its argmax prediction demoted to exploratory BEFORE the freeze. Frozen into O = sum_h e_L(h) g(h)/||g||_2 with 28 cell specifications, predicted O and rank, the named band and the thresholds, hashed into configs/FREEZE.sha256; the confirmation entry point raises without it (proved adversarially in results/gate_freeze.json).

  WHAT SURVIVED OUT OF SAMPLE (verdict PARTIAL, pre-registered ladder). Over 20 matched-energy confirmation cells (12 edited layers each, energy matched within 0.6%, 70 held-out-category StrongREJECT pairs per language) Spearman(O_SL, surviving Slovene strict refusal) = -0.903, CI [-0.928,-0.857], permutation p<0.001; within each energy level separately -0.967 (E2) and -0.948 (E3). Nested over log removal energy: dR2 0.580, leave-one-cell-out 0.594. O beats log energy (-0.384), depth span (-0.039) and mean depth (-0.328) with paired-bootstrap CIs excluding zero. All six controls (3 layer-matched random, 3 energy-matched PC draws, energy matched to 0.03%, collateral inside the real cells' range) are null: |dSL| <= 0.03 against a no-op of 0.957.

  THE THREE BOUNDARIES THE PAPER MUST CARRY. (1) THE EXPENSIVE INSTRUMENT DOES NOT EARN ITS COST: the same overlap from a FOUR-number band profile (LOO dR2 0.845) and the purely geometric EN/SL cosine overlap (0.834) beat O's 0.594, and the same cell's English outcome predicts the Slovene one at rho 0.945 - indistinguishable from O. The 48-layer profile establishes THAT placement matters, not the cheapest way to measure it. (2) THE NAMED BAND LOST: the DEV argmax names 25-36, but at matched energy band 13-24 removes more judged Slovene refusal (0.30 vs 0.53 at E=27.8) - NAMED_AND_LOST at both levels. The reason is a metric flip: the 33-substring opener rule ranks 25-36 first, judged STRICT ranks 13-24 first, judged BROAD ranks 25-36 first; band 25-36 buys its opener-rule 'success' with PARTIAL responses (mean strict-minus-rule gap 0.182, max 0.514). (3) NOT CHECKPOINT-SPECIFIC ON THESE SCREENS: the GaMS3 profile predicts the sibling checkpoint's 50 weight cells at -0.442, no worse than its own panel's -0.278; both screens are weak because unmatched panels let dose swamp placement.

  PLACEMENT VS DOSE. The A1-A4 ladder (shipped edit, sibling kernel, and each rescaled to the other's energy) sits at the refusal floor: dose moves the outcome at fixed placement (-0.186 and -0.157, McNemar p 0.001/0.003) while placement does not at fixed dose (-0.029, 0.000). A declared POST-FREEZE exploratory pair at E=13.9/27.8 confirms the two production kernels are indistinguishable once dose is matched (d 0.071 and 0.029, CIs including zero) - both spread mass over the effective band. Both accounts are real in their own stratum: placement orders cells at fixed dose, dose lowers refusal by 0.114 at fixed placement.

  JUDGE HONESTY. The budgeted gpt-4.1 certification could NOT be bought (platform key hit its daily limit; $0.00 spent, deviation D10), so certification fell back to on-disk gpt-4.1 labels for GaMS3 edited arms: harmful-row kappa SL 0.830 (PASS, confirmatory) and EN 0.721 (MISS, JUDGE_SENSITIVE, blocked from confirmatory reading). A free third channel (the iteration-3 refusal classifier) run on THIS pod's own cells agrees item-wise at kappa 0.66 SL / 0.43 EN but reproduces the cell-level ordering at Spearman 0.975 / 0.954, so no claim here depends on the scorer.

  AUDIT. rederive.py reproduces 352/352 headline numbers through a code path importing nothing from the analysis, and in that same path both placebos collapse (cell-permutation null +0.003, energy-profile-shuffled null -0.017, both p<0.0001 against the real -0.903); the freeze predates every confirmation file. 10 deviations with evidence files. Reusable by later rounds at their relative paths: configs/frozen_predictions.json (the instrument), results/cells/ (all judged generations and per-layer energy profiles), results/cells.csv, results/per_item.parquet, figures/fig1-fig5.

  and 105 DEFINITION_SENSITIVE. SCOPE: NF4 guard pass (Llama-Guard NF4 vs bf16 agreement .967). In the Gemma edit, SL non-refusals
  are more often guard-safe than EN (+.23 [.12,.35]): non-actionable rather than compliant. Flip analysis for Gemma: slope
  reduced but not collapsed (.50 EN, .34 SL), intercept -6.7/-5.3, refit AUROC .997, i.e. a criterion shift plus partial coupling
  loss while the information survives. GaMS3 is not estimable. NF4 vs bf16: weight error .093, yet the edit-energy profile
  cosine is .999998; 32-token KL .11/.09; bf16 behavioural paired gap +.60 [.40,.80] vs NF4 +.45 [.20,.70], so the effect
  is bounded, not closed. Paste-ready repairs R1-R10 with source paths (lint 0), including the iteration-1 section restored
  verbatim. The independent stdlib recompute of 102 iteration-3 numbers finds 4.9% [2.1,11.0] wrong; all placebos collapse.

title: Finding the closest prior work for two results
summary: >-
  Positioning artifact (web research only; no code, no GPU, no paid API, $0 spend) that gives both of this run's reportable
  results the neighbours the reviewer said they lacked. Deliverables in results/: a 30-row neighbour table (markdown + JSON,
  N1-N30) where every row carries a verbatim <=40-word quote with its locator, a URL, an access date (2026-09-24) and a verified  flag; two paste-ready positioning paragraphs (positive and negative) each stating its own stopping point; a 30-row claims_to_position.csv
  in which no claim is left without either a neighbour id or an evidenced NO NEIGHBOUR FOUND; reconciliation_map.csv (claim
  id -> neighbour ids -> producing file path -> tag -> paper sections that must agree); a tagged ledger separating 14 FAILED
  HYPOTHESES (each with the number and direction that killed it) from 10 UNEXECUTED PROPOSALS (each with its reason); the
  canonical stopping-points block for verbatim reuse; the full search log; and scripts/self_check.py, which passes. KEY OUTCOMES
  FOR THE PAPER. (1) The inherited '2-3 middle layers' attribution is RESOLVED: the sentence does exist in arXiv 2607.02714
  SS3.2, but as that paper's own attribution to Arditi et al. - which was not found in Arditi et al. by full-text search -
  and 2607.02714 rejects it in the next sentence, having found uniform layer spread beats signal-norm-based selection by up
  to ~70pp. It must not be cited as a standing depth fact. (2) The positive's delta is NARROWED: effect-based site selection
  (Hase 2023; 2609.22135; 2606.00926) and language-specific safety depths (2609.22144; 2605.23036) are already published.
  What survives is the matched-total-energy AND matched-layer-count placement contrast, per language, with the effective region
  differing between two sibling checkpoints - no neighbour found running that construction. (3) The negative now has four
  partial neighbours (Hase 2023; 2606.00926; 2609.04721 on cosine unreliability; 2608.24988 on weight-edit geometry surviving
  behavioural reversion) and an EVIDENCED ABSENCE for the conjunction, with the eight queries behind it logged; the wording
  prescribed is 'not found by these queries'. (4) The selection-blindness finding must be positioned against AdvPrefix (2412.10321),
  not StrongREJECT: AdvPrefix owns objective misspecification inside an optimiser for prompt attacks, so this run's claim
  is the weight-edit instance quantified on the search's own candidate population. (5) Tooling state, dated 2026-09-24: Heretic's
  default scorer on master is still the 33-marker substring counter plus KL over an English prompt set, although a benchmark
  scorer (PR #444, merged Sep 3 2026) and dataset config selection (PR #445, merged Sep 5 2026) are merged, and the community
  multilingual set covers 9 languages with no Slovene. Every line is tagged OBSERVATION / INTERPRETATION / FAILED HYPOTHESIS
  / UNEXECUTED PROPOSAL, and every number about this run carries the path of the file that produced it.

</new_artifacts_this_iteration>

<data_files>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_files>

<task>
Write the run's internal research report as markdown, with figure placeholders and, where a
claim cites outside work, a BibTeX-backed reference. <report_rules> above says what the document
is; this says what to do to it now.

YOUR TURN (gen_report_text): APPEND this iteration's section.

You are the researcher keeping the lab notebook. The text in <previous_report> is what the run
has recorded so far. Your job is to add to it, not to rewrite it.

1. CARRY THE REPORT FORWARD VERBATIM. Reproduce <previous_report> in full, unchanged, as the
   start of your output. The only edits allowed to an earlier section are factual corrections —
   a number that has since been shown wrong, a claim an artifact has since disproved — and each
   one is marked in place as a correction, with what changed and why.
2. WRITE THIS ITERATION'S SECTION and put it at the END. Four things, in this order:
   (a) WHY THIS ITERATION RAN WHAT IT RAN — the strategy, and what in <reviewer_feedback> or the
       hypothesis update prompted it.
   (b) WHAT HAPPENED — every artifact in <new_artifacts_this_iteration>: what it did, and its
       results IN FULL. Read the output files in each artifact's workspace and typeset every
       table you find. This is the only place those numbers are ever written down.
   (c) WHAT WAS LEARNED — what the evidence now supports, what it rules out, and any direction
       this iteration killed, labelled as a dead end with the evidence that killed it.
   (d) WHAT THE NEXT ITERATION TAKES FROM IT — the open question this iteration hands forward.
3. KEEP THE CLOSING SECTION CURRENT. The report ends with a "What we have learned so far"
   section covering the whole run; rewrite that one each iteration so it reflects the evidence
   as it now stands.
4. ADDRESS THE REVIEW WHERE IT WAS RIGHT. <reviewer_feedback> reviews the report for
   completeness and traceability, not for salesmanship. A critique that says a result is
   missing, unsupported, or untraceable to its artifact is fixed at the place it points to.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
THE REPORT'S FIGURES ARE CHARTS OF THIS RUN'S OWN NUMBERS. Nothing else. Every figure here is
rendered deterministically by the aii-data-fig-gen skill from the values you supply, so each bar
is exactly the height of its number and a reader can check the figure against the table beside
it. There is no image model in this document and no `figure_type` to choose: the schema takes
data figures only. Conceptual artwork, architecture drawings and flow diagrams belong to the
publishable paper, which is written later and separately.

WHAT BECOMES A FIGURE, AND WHAT DOES NOT:
  - A chart, when the point is a SHAPE the eye reads faster than the digits: a trend over a
    sweep, a gap between conditions, a distribution, a trade-off front, a confusion matrix, an
    ablation delta.
  - A MARKDOWN TABLE, when the point is the values themselves. Tabular data stays a table. A
    four-row result table redrawn as a chart loses the exact numbers and gains nothing.
  - Nothing at all, when neither: not every iteration earns a figure, and an empty one costs the
    reader a page turn.

FIGURE FORMAT: put a [FIGURE:fig_id] marker in the report text where the chart belongs — inside the
iteration section that produced its numbers, next to the table or the paragraph it settles — and
give the full spec in the separate `figures` structured-output array. Every id in the array
matches a marker in the text, and every marker matches an id.

Set `aspect_ratio` per figure: 16:9 for side-by-side comparisons and multi-panel results, 4:3
for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps / confusion matrices / scatter plots, 21:9 for a long timeline
or a wide many-category bar chart.

Example in the report text:
  "...tail latency fell by more than half while throughput dropped to a quarter.

[FIGURE:fig3]

The sweep in Table 2 shows..."

Example in the figures array:
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Latency across the three optimizers", "caption": "Geometric mean query latency, with standard error over 40 queries. The learned optimizer is 2.3x faster than PostgreSQL's planner.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. Categories: PostgreSQL, Bao, RLQOpt. One series 'Latency'. Values: 4.6, 2.8, 2.0 seconds. Errors: 0.8, 0.5, 0.3. X-axis label 'Optimizer'. Y-axis label 'Latency (s)', range 0-5.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

CRITICAL: before writing a figure spec, open the artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and read the exact values out of them. The renderer cannot read files — every number, series
name, axis label and unit MUST be in `image_gen_detailed_description`, unrounded and exactly as
the run produced it. A figure whose numbers disagree with the table above it is a defect in the
record.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib, aii-web-tools.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then batch-fetch real BibTeX with the aii_semscholar_bib__fetch
script and `--out ./references.bib`. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Only a paper that
script returns is cited: never hand-write an entry, and leave out one it cannot find.
TODO 3. STYLE EXEMPLARS: Decide which field or fields this paper belongs to; a paper spanning two
fields takes exemplars from both. If `./style_exemplars.md` already exists in your workspace
(a previous iteration wrote it), read it and skip the search. Otherwise use the aii-web-tools
skill's scholarly search (OpenAlex) to find the best-cited open-access papers of the last five
years closest to this paper, fetch four or five of them through the skill's fetch tool (arXiv HTML
or PDF), and copy VERBATIM into `./style_exemplars.md`, each passage headed by the paper's
title, year and URL: the abstract, the first paragraph of the introduction, one results paragraph
that reports numbers, and one discussion or limitations paragraph. Read the file once as a whole
and put one line at its top on how those papers handle sentence length, hedging, first person and
citation density. Their sentences and their content are never reused; they are exemplars of style,
not sources.

When you build the file, also record how those same papers are ORGANISED. At its end, under the
heading `## Section outlines`, give each paper its title and then its section headings in
order, worded as the paper words them, with the subsections of its method and results sections;
then one line on how its method is organised (by component, by pipeline stage, by theorem) and one
on how its results are organised (by research question, by dataset, main results then ablations).
Headings and those two lines only, no prose from the sections. The outlines are for the
publishable paper written at the end of the run, which checks its own section list against them;
they are not a structure for the report you are writing now.

Then, from those same papers — abstracts, method and results sections — plus every title in any
`references.bib` you have compiled, extract THE FIELD'S OWN VOCABULARY: the words it uses for its
concepts, its metrics and its experimental conditions. Write 50 to
150 of them to `./domain_terms.json` as a JSON array, each entry
{"term": "...", "gloss": "one clause saying what it means", "source_title": "the paper you took it
from"}. Terms only — no sentences, no section names, no author names. This file is what the final
paper is checked against: a name that is in it is the field's name and passes, a technical term
that is not is treated as an invented one and has to be defined or replaced. If the file already
exists, read it and add only what is missing.
TODO 4. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]."

ON AN APPEND: the markers are part of the report, not scaffolding. Every [ARTIFACT:id] marker
in <previous_report> is carried forward unchanged, and every claim in your new section that
rests on an artifact gets one. Re-typing an earlier section is the moment they get lost — a
text that comes back with no markers at all, while <all_artifacts> is non-empty, is an
incomplete report and goes back to you.
TODO 5. WRITE THE SECTION: Carry <previous_report> forward verbatim, then write this iteration's
section at the end, per <task> and <report_rules>. Put [FIGURE:fig_id] markers where a chart of this
run's numbers belongs, per <figure_instructions>, and give the specs in the figures array. Cite outside work
with numeric references [1], [2], and keep the bibliography section at the very end of the text,
after the iteration sections. Every table from every artifact this iteration ran goes in, in
full. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate image/figure files. Do NOT emit your structured output
when the section is written — TODO 6 is a separate pass over it first.

REQUIRED FILE: the report text lives in `./paper_draft.md` in your workspace. Write the full text
there as you go — carried-forward sections plus what you have of this iteration's — overwriting
it as it grows. This is a REQUIRED output file: the pipeline reads the report from this file and
from nowhere else, and it is also what survives if the run is interrupted, so keep it current
rather than treating it as a first draft you move on from.
TODO 6. APPEND PASS — start this ONLY once TODO 5's section is written, and treat it as a distinct
pass over the finished text. An append is a different job from a revision, and its failure modes
are the opposite ones, so check for these:

1. NOTHING EARLIER WAS REWRITTEN. Diff your text against <previous_report> in your head, section
   by section. Every earlier section reads exactly as it did, except where you marked a factual
   correction in place. A section silently reworded is the run's own history edited after the
   fact, and the reasoning it held is then gone for good.
2. NOTHING WAS SUMMARISED AWAY. Every table an artifact produced this iteration is present with
   its actual numbers. Go back to each artifact workspace and check the output files against
   what you wrote. "Improved over baseline" where a table exists is the defect.
3. THE DEAD ENDS ARE STILL THERE. Anything this iteration abandoned is written down as
   abandoned, with what killed it.
4. THE REASONING IS THERE, NOT JUST THE RESULT. For each artifact: why it was chosen, not only
   what it returned. A reader must be able to reconstruct the decision.
5. THE CLOSING SECTION IS CURRENT. "What we have learned so far" reflects this iteration too.
6. `summary` describes the run's finding as it now stands — never the revision. Write what the
   evidence supports today, with its headline number; a sentence about what changed since the
   last iteration is the wrong answer to this field.
7. IT READS. Take the section you just wrote start to finish as a researcher who was not on this
   run. Every table is introduced by a sentence that says what it settles; no paragraph is a
   list of decimals with connectives; nothing turns on a label only this run knows. Move the
   digits into the tables and captions and let the sentences carry the comparison. Then read one
   exemplar passage beside a paragraph of yours: the sentences should sound like theirs, per
   <writing_register>. This is the one item that is about the prose rather than the contents, and
   it is not optional: an unreadable complete record is a record nobody reads.

Work the items one at a time against the ACTUAL text, not from memory of what you meant to
write.
TODO 7. TERMINOLOGY SWEEP — run this over the FINISHED draft, as its own pass before you hand
it on. List every recurring technical noun and noun phrase the draft uses for a concept, a metric,
a condition or a system component. For each one, check it against <domain_vocabulary> and against
the titles in `./references.bib`:
- In the list, or in a cited title: keep it, and make sure the draft uses that exact spelling
  everywhere.
- Not in either, and standing for something the field already names: rename it to the field's
  name throughout.
- Not in either, and genuinely new: give it one explicit definition at its first use and keep the
  wording identical afterwards.
- A bare code in a sentence (C1, M3): replace it with the name of the thing.
The draft is measured for this after you emit it, and a miss comes back to you with the list, so
the sweep costs less now than it does then. `./domain_terms.json` holds the same list on
disk if you would rather read it there.

The report is the paper's only source, so a private label invented here is one the paper
inherits. Sweep the section you just wrote; earlier sections keep the words they already have,
except where a rename is the factual correction <task> allows and you mark it as one.

Then use 'ls' to verify `./paper_draft.md` exists and holds the whole report, and emit the
structured JSON — that is your ONLY output. It carries the title, abstract, figures and summary,
plus `out_expected_files` naming `paper_draft.md`; the report text itself stays in the file.
Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate image/figure files at any point.

```
i want a reproducible bilingual study of refusal suppression in google/gemma-3-12b-it and cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct, with room for a genuine scientific discovery. compare each original model with one Heretic-abliterated version, evaluating all four checkpoints in English and Slovene. establish the safety–utility trade-offs, then investigate what explains them internally.

the attached research plan defines the intended study and supplies literature leads. verify its factual claims and references. this prompt governs execution: keep the core comparison fixed, but choose the mechanistic methods and discovery direction yourself. do not assume the expected findings are true.

Gemma-IT is a same-family, same-size aligned reference, not the direct training parent of GaMS-Instruct. endpoint differences cannot establish what Slovene continual pretraining, instruction tuning, or the small safety-training set caused.

step 1 - explore and establish feasibility. load both original models, pin revisions, verify their official tokenizers and chat templates, and inspect behavior and activations on a small development set in both languages. check coherent output, baseline refusal, and hidden-state extraction. use text-only inputs and comparable precision and inference settings; record unavoidable differences. inspect where the models behave similarly and where they differ, without committing to a mechanism. estimate the compute needed before scaling up. use separate smoke-test data and keep final evaluation untouched. if an edit fails or destroys language ability, investigate and report the failure rather than quietly substituting another model or calling incoherence successful refusal suppression.

step 2 - find the scientific opening. develop 5–7 distinct, falsifiable explanations or research directions from the pilot and the literature. search beyond refusal-vector papers, including multilingual representations, decision calibration, causal intervention, and capability interference. actively try to disprove novelty by reading the closest primary sources. select one or two promising directions for deeper experiments.

possible starting points: does cross-language intervention transfer depend on something that direction cosine misses? can we distinguish loss of harmfulness information from a changed mapping between that information and refusal? does interference with language-relevant computation explain different utility costs? these are suggestions, not required findings or an exhaustive menu. replace them if the evidence points somewhere better.

for each selected hypothesis, state its prediction, strongest competing explanation, simplest baseline, and a result that would falsify it. discovering that familiar geometry fails to predict behavior can be valuable if you establish its boundary. merely applying Heretic to GaMS, observing EN–SL vector similarity, or finding separable harmfulness after refusal declines is insufficient by itself as a novelty claim. if an exploratory hypothesis fails the novelty check, replace that hypothesis while preserving the core study.

step 3 - freeze the data and intervention protocol. separate Heretic construction/optimization data, mechanistic development data, held-out mechanistic validation, and final behavioral evaluation. keep translations, paraphrases, and harmful/harmless counterparts from the same semantic source together when splitting. audit overlap by source and meaning, not only exact strings. Heretic's default sources and Semantic-Harmful/Semantic-Harmless may overlap; those pairs cannot automatically serve as independent validation.

create one main Heretic checkpoint per original model using the same pinned version, English prompt source, comparable objectives, and equal search budgets. choose checkpoints by a declared development-only rule balancing refusal reduction and harmless divergence. evaluate that same English-derived edit in both languages. a community Gemma edit is a sanity reference, not a substitute for the matched main intervention. record configurations, seeds, selected trials, precision, and checkpoint hashes. distinguish differences in achieved optimization from intrinsic model properties. additional seeds or edit strengths may support a focused robustness analysis, but keep them separate from the four core checkpoints.

step 4 - measure behavior and utility. use the official NASK-PIB/RefusEU evaluation data for English and Slovene, following its published scoring protocol where reproducible. report harmful compliance/attack success, refusal, and language consistency separately. refusal and harmful compliance are not complements: ambiguous, irrelevant, malformed, and empty outputs need explicit treatment. include a small independent benign safety-adjacent set to measure over-refusal. a model that refuses everything, or cannot answer coherently, must not look successful.

use the same frozen judge and rubric across conditions, with model identity hidden. check scoring sensitivity using a second independent judge on a stratified sample. prepare a blinded EN/SL sample for human review; if qualified human review is unavailable, mark it pending and state the limitation instead of claiming it happened.

for utility, use Slovenian LLM Eval and the corresponding English tasks: ARC-Challenge, BoolQ, HellaSwag, OpenBookQA, PIQA, and Winogrande. report individual tasks and their macro-average, emphasizing original-to-edited changes within each language. also measure harmless divergence on held-out inputs, wrong-language output, repetition, and output validity. Heretic's optimization KL alone is not independent evidence of preserved utility.

do not assume RefusEU examples sharing an ID are exact translations, or that EN and SL benchmark difficulty is identical. verify correspondence before making paired cross-language claims. use a separate faithful EN/SL contrast set for controlled language comparisons. translate only missing material, preserve semantic IDs, document translation checks, and distinguish automated checks from native-speaker review. published model-card scores are context and sanity checks; measure the four checkpoints yourself under the same protocol.

step 5 - connect representations to behavior. complete the mechanistic core: layer-wise bilingual harmful/harmless direction characterization in both originals, and held-out harmfulness separability before and after Heretic. choose and justify activation locations and token positions. select layers, probes, and hyperparameters on development data only.

control for topic, wording, prompt length, language identity, and response leakage. decoding harmfulness from generated refusal text is not evidence that a pre-response harmfulness signal drives refusal. compare a frozen original-model probe with appropriately cross-validated probes refitted after editing where useful: failure of the frozen probe can reflect representation drift rather than information loss. do not interpret raw cross-model vector cosine as shared mechanism without establishing comparable coordinates.

relate internal measurements to actual behavioral changes in each language. high probe accuracy establishes decodability, not causal use. a harmful-minus-harmless direction is only refusal-associated until interventions support a stronger interpretation. changes in a direction directly targeted by Heretic are expected and cannot alone carry the discovery.

step 6 - pursue the strongest explanation. use the freedom from step 2 to design the smallest decisive experiment. where justified, extract EN- and SL-derived directions and test the source-language × evaluation-language transfer matrix within each model. choose intervention locations and strengths on development data, and include no-op and matched random-direction controls plus benign utility checks. keep these activation interventions separate from the main Heretic comparison.

you may instead pursue subspaces, layer-specific interventions, representation-to-action coupling, or another approach supported by the pilot. the goal is a result that distinguishes competing explanations and predicts something on untouched data. use held-out semantic categories or an independent prompt source to challenge it. explain what survives, what breaks, and where the claim stops. prefer one well-tested insight over a large collection of loosely connected metrics. preserve the behavioral and mechanistic core even if every novelty candidate fails.

step 7 - test the claims honestly. freeze primary outcomes and confirmatory analyses before final evaluation. report original-to-edited effects for each model and language, with effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals. compare those changes across models and languages without attributing them to a specific training stage.

state the resampling and aggregation units. pair outputs on the same prompts and cluster translations/paraphrases by underlying semantic item; use cross-language pairing only where correspondence is established. four checkpoints, many layers, or many prompts do not create many independent model families. prompt-level uncertainty also does not measure variation across Heretic optimization runs. account for searching across hypotheses and layers, separate exploratory from confirmatory results, and state when sample sizes cannot resolve a difference. if resources require subsampling, freeze a stratified sample before viewing results and narrow the claims accordingly.

bonus - examine cjvt/GaMS3-12B as a bounded pre-instruction diagnostic. test harmfulness separability and a small EN/SL behavior sample with appropriate base-model formatting. do not compare its raw refusal rate with chat models as if the tasks were identical. only attempt base abliteration if refusal-like behavior is reproducible, the intervention has an interpretable target, and it does not jeopardize the main study. intermediate training checkpoints and no-safety training controls belong to a later extension unless already available.

deliver a reproducible repository and a paper grounded in executed experiments: pinned dependencies, split manifests, configurations, per-example outputs and scores, analysis scripts, and figures covering the four checkpoints in both languages. distinguish observations, interpretations, failed hypotheses, and unexecuted proposals. recompute every headline number from saved results and reconcile the abstract, tables, figures, and conclusions after the final audit. the discovery may change as evidence accumulates; the final paper must reflect the strongest claim that actually survives.

The agent loaded the **aii-web-tools** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Runs web search, page fetch as markdown, and regex grep over full HTML or PDF text via this skill's own scripts (aii_fast_web_search.py, aii_fast_web_fetch.py) — a free-first keyless search stack with Serper fallback that works even where built-in WebSearch and WebFetch are absent. Use when a query, page, or paper must be searched, read, or mined for an exact quote, number, table value, or methodology sentence, and whenever a lossy summary would lose the detail. Triggers: web search, scholarly search, OpenAlex, Crossref, Serper, fetch a URL as markdown, read a PDF, arXiv, regex grep a page, exact quote, table value, citation check. NOT for: planning a broad multi-source literature review or mass verification campaign — use aii-web-research-tools; NOT for a PDF file already on disk — extraction, form filling, merging and PDF creation are anthropic-pdf; NOT for driving a browser or testing a UI."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

### [8] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-09-24 21:35:11 UTC

```
This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user (actually an automated AI Inventor pipeline) requires writing/appending to an internal research report (`paper_draft.md`) for iteration 4 of a bilingual study examining refusal suppression in google/gemma-3-12b-it and cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct. The task is to:
   - Carry forward the previous report (iterations 1-3) VERBATIM with only marked factual corrections
   - Apply 10 blocking report repairs demanded by the reviewer (restoring iteration-1 content, fixing misinterpretations, adding missing tables, correcting numbers, etc.)
   - Append a new Iteration 4 section documenting 5 new artifacts (experiments 13-15, evaluation 2, research 1)
   - Update the closing "What we have learned so far" section
   - Output structured JSON to `.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json`
   - Write `.aii/manifest.yaml` and `README.md` for the workspace
   
   The workspace is: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Fapgmt6JWbcD/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/`
   
   SECURITY CONSTRAINTS (verbatim): "The shared OpenRouter key works again... Do not print or save the key." and "The user's email address is subscriptions-ai-claude1@ijs.si. Use it only to identify the user... Never send it to an unrelated service."
   
   WORKSPACE CONSTRAINT (verbatim): "CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory... You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY."

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Abliteration/Heretic**: Weight editing that orthogonalizes model parameters against a refusal direction, optimized by TPE search
   - **Refusal direction**: A single direction in activation space whose removal suppresses refusal behavior
   - **Surrogacy gap**: R2*(EN→EN) - R2*(EN→SL) measuring what English outcomes miss about Slovene
   - **Causal write profile e_L(h)**: Per-layer judged refusal drop from single-site ablation, defining where refusal is "written" in depth
   - **Overlap instrument O**: sum_h e_L(h)g(h)/||g|| measuring alignment between edit energy and where refusal is causally written
   - **Gradient-blind fraction (GBF)**: Share of optimizer candidate pairs where the objective moves less than measurement noise while judged refusal spans the full range
   - **Threshold blindness (TBF)**: Whether the objective floor sits above the selection rule's threshold
   - **PARTIAL compliance**: Caveat-laden responses that fire keyword markers but aren't full refusals - the wedge between strict and broad gap definitions
   - **Matched-energy placement contrast**: Comparing weight edits at identical total removal energy and layer count but different depth bands
   - **NF4 quantization**: 4-bit NormalFloat used throughout; single bf16 control cell added in iteration 4
   - **Judge-sensitivity**: Claims whose truth value changes depending on which judge (keyword/Qwen3-14B/gpt-4.1) or definition (strict/broad) is used

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **Experiment 13 report_tables.md** (art_NpZ_nW6qgSKD, Gemma overlap instrument):
     - VERDICT: FALSIFIED for instrument claim, but PLACEMENT STRONGLY CONFIRMED
     - DEV profile: EN split-half 0.84, SL 0.51; argmax EN=19, SL=16
     - Confirmation: O Spearman EN -0.96 [-0.98,-0.84], SL -0.83 [-0.84,-0.82]
     - 8 matched groups all favor high-O (pooled EN -0.688 [-0.75,-0.62], SL -0.377 [-0.45,-0.30])
     - Controls null (random/PC within ±0.03 of no-op)
     - dR2(O|logE) = 0.026 EN (powered, MDE 0.047), 0.052 SL (inconclusive)
     - O collinear with g-weighted cosine (rho 0.81/0.76)
     - Nested R²: logE alone 0.088; +O 0.668; +O_cos 0.790; +O_band4 0.806
     - EN outcome predicts SL at rho 0.945 (indistinguishable from O)
     - Qwen3-8B: 9/9 matched contrasts favor high-O; Spearman EN -0.76, SL -0.93, DE -0.84
     - Judge: within-edited kappa 0.818 pooled; EN 0.856 PASS, SL 0.744 FAIL
     - Dose rival: 2x late-layer edit still leaves EN 0.88/SL 0.92
     - Best placement: G3 layers 16-31 gives EN 0.07/SL 0.27 vs layers 33-48 EN 0.92/SL 0.92

   - **Experiment 14 report_tables.md** (art_bxpIbe7-nSvR, GaMS3 write profile):
     - Verdict: PARTIAL
     - Causal write profile peaks at h=27; band mass EN 0.00/1.05/1.50/0.27, SL 0.02/0.55/0.57/0.05
     - Split-half reliability: EN 0.812, SL 0.312 → SL profile DECLARED UNRELIABLE
     - Predicted band 25-36, but actual winner is 13-24 → NAMED_AND_LOST at both energy levels
     - Metric flip: opener rule ranks 25-36 first, judged STRICT ranks 13-24 first
     - O_SL Spearman = -0.903 [-0.928,-0.857], beats logE (-0.384), span (-0.039), mean_depth (-0.328)

     - THREE BOUNDARIES: (1) band4 LOO dR2 0.845 and cosine overlap 0.834 beat O's 0.594 - expensive instrument doesn't earn cost; (2) DEV argmax names wrong band; (3) GaMS3 profile predicts sibling at -0.442, no worse than its own -0.278
     - Placement vs dose (A1-A4 ladder): dose moves at fixed placement (-0.186/-0.157, p 0.001/0.003), placement doesn't at fixed dose (-0.029/0.000, ns)
     - Judge: EN kappa 0.721 (MISS/JUDGE_SENSITIVE), SL 0.830 (PASS)

   - **Experiment 15 analysis.json** (art_F46S3uP80BUa, scorer blindness):

     - Reselection table: Gemma K→trial 107 (fallback), C→trial 98 (primary), J→trial 64 (primary); GaMS3 K→trial 88 (fallback), C→trial 85 (primary)
     - Judge gate: gpt-4.1 subsample kappa 0.850 [0.772,0.911], n=800, $0.86; classifier on GaMS3 without refit: kappa 0.841

   - **Evaluation 2** (art_hBuck7q0dnxG, partial/judges/recount):
     - Judge calibration: n=900 (515 bought + 385 free); overall weighted kappa 0.873; keyword 0.074; classifier 0.919

     - Flip analysis for Gemma: EN slope_ratio 0.50 [0.24,0.86], intercept -6.65; SL slope_ratio 0.34 [0.19,0.54], intercept -5.32; both refit AUROC ≥0.995 → MIXED (criterion shift + partial coupling loss, information present)
     - GaMS3: NOT_ESTIMABLE in both languages (too few refusals after edit)
     - C3 PARTIAL transition: FALSIFIED (nonparametric argmax Delta_peak L1 +0.45 [-0.45,0.90])
     - 40/211 gap claims JUDGE_SENSITIVE, 105 DEFINITION_SENSITIVE
     - NF4 vs bf16: weight error 0.093, energy profile cosine 0.999998; bf16 paired gap +0.60 vs NF4 +0.45
     - Iteration-3 independent recompute: 4.9% [2.1,11.0] wrong; all placebos collapse

   - **Research 1** (art_sZ5w0yoY9o6L, positioning):
     - Positioning positive: delta is matched-total-energy AND matched-layer-count placement contrast per language with effective region differing between siblings. Effect-based site selection and language-specific depths already published.
     - Positioning negative: activation-space depth measurement failing to predict weight-edit outcomes across languages, while two one-forward-pass baselines succeed. Four partial neighbours found; conjunction is "not found by these queries."
     - Selection blindness positioned against AdvPrefix (arXiv 2412.10321)
     - '2-3 middle layers' attribution RESOLVED: exists in 2607.02714 but rejected in the next sentence

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - No errors encountered yet in this session. All tool calls succeeded.
   - The BibTeX fetch returned all 22 references successfully.
   - Some evaluation-2 JSON files had empty structures when queried (curve_fits.json C3 keys, judge_calibration summary) - needed different access patterns.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully loaded all 3 required skills
   - Found that style_exemplars.md, domain_terms.json, and references.bib already exist from a previous iteration
   - Fetched all needed new BibTeX references in one batch call
   - Read key results from all 5 new artifacts, extracting the numbers needed for the report tables
   - Still need to read: iteration-1 original report (for restoration), evaluation-2 paste-ready repairs, remaining evaluation-2 data files

6. All User Messages:
   - Message 1 (the only actual user message): An extremely long pasted content block containing the full system prompt, previous report, reviewer feedback, hypothesis update, all 18 artifact summaries, new artifacts this iteration, figure instructions, TODO list, and the original user request for "a reproducible bilingual study of refusal suppression." This is the pipeline prompt, not a conversational user message. The actual human's original request is embedded at the end asking for the bilingual study with specific methodological requirements.

7. Pending Tasks (from the task tracker):
   - Task #2 (in_progress): Literature review and BibTeX fetch - BibTeX fetched, but need to verify completeness
   - Task #4 (in_progress): Read all new iteration-4 artifacts - mostly done, need a few more files
   - Task #5 (pending): Read iteration-1 original report for restoration (reviewer MUST-FIX)
   - Task #6 (pending): Read evaluation-2 paste-ready repairs R1-R10
   - Task #7 (pending): Write the full report (carry forward + append iteration 4)
   - Task #8 (pending): Append pass verification
   - Task #9 (pending): Terminology sweep
   - Task #10 (pending): Emit structured JSON output (write `.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json`, `.aii/manifest.yaml`, `README.md`)

8. Current Work:
   I was in the middle of reading artifact output files (Task #4). I had just finished reading:
   - Experiment 13 (Gemma overlap): report_tables.md completely read
   - Experiment 14 (GaMS3 write profile): report_tables.md completely read
   - Experiment 15 (scorer blindness): analysis.json key fields extracted, reselection_table.csv read
   - Evaluation 2: judge_calibration.json read, flip_analysis.json read, but many other files not yet read (curve_fits.json for C3 details, asr_summary.json, quant_confound.json, pending_human_review_iter4.md, audit_log_iter4.json, corrected_numbers_iter4.json)
   - Research 1: positioning_positive.md and positioning_negative.md read

   I still need to read:
   - The iteration-1 original report at `iter_1/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/report.md` (Task #5 - required by reviewer MUST-FIX #4)
   - Evaluation-2's remaining files including ASR, quant confound, C3 curve fits, pending human review list
   - The existing paper_draft.md to understand what was previously written
   - Evaluation-2 paste-ready repairs (if they exist as a separate file)

9. Optional Next Step:
   Continue reading remaining artifact files needed for the report. The immediate next steps are:
   1. Read the iteration-1 original report from `iter_1/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/report.md` (reviewer MUST-FIX #4 requires verbatim restoration)
   2. Read evaluation-2's remaining key files (asr_summary.json, curve_fits.json for C3, quant_confound.json, pending_human_review_iter4.md)
   3. Read the existing paper_draft.md to understand current state
   4. Then proceed to Task #7: actually writing the full report

   The most recent work was extracting data from artifacts. From the TODO: "TODO 4. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations, algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results."

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /root/.claude/projects/-ai-inventor-aii-data-runs-run-Fapgmt6JWbcD-3-invention-loop-iter-4-gen-report-text-gen-report-text/e2bdb1a5-a4da-4e49-b634-ef9f7b3b0b70.jsonl
Continue the conversation from where it left off without asking the user any further questions. Resume directly — do not acknowledge the summary, do not recap what was happening, do not preface with "I'll continue" or similar. Pick up the last task as if the break never happened.

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user (an automated AI Inventor pipeline) requires writing/appending to an internal research report (`paper_draft.md`) for iteration 4 of a bilingual study examining refusal suppression in google/gemma-3-12b-it and cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct. The specific tasks are:
   - Carry forward the previous report (iterations 1-3) VERBATIM with only marked factual corrections
   - Apply 9 blocking MUST-FIX reviewer repairs (restoring iteration-1 content, fixing misinterpretations, correcting numbers, making claims model-specific, restating surviving claim as bounded by optimization strength)
   - Append a new Iteration 4 section documenting 5 new artifacts (experiments 13-15, evaluation 2, research 1)
   - Update the closing "What we have learned so far" section
   - Output structured JSON to `.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json`
   - Write `.aii/manifest.yaml` and `README.md` for the workspace

   SECURITY CONSTRAINTS (verbatim): "The shared OpenRouter key works again... Do not print or save the key." and "The user's email address is subscriptions-ai-claude1@ijs.si. Use it only to identify the user... Never send it to an unrelated service, such as in a request header, URL, or payload, unless the user explicitly asks."
   
   WORKSPACE CONSTRAINT (verbatim): "CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory... You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY."
   
   Workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Fapgmt6JWbcD/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/`

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Abliteration/Heretic**: Weight editing that orthogonalizes model parameters against a refusal direction, optimized by TPE search
   - **Causal write profile e_L(h)**: Per-layer judged refusal drop from single-site ablation; peaks at layer 19 in Gemma, layer 27 in GaMS3
   - **Write-mass overlap O**: sum_h e_L(h)g(h)/||g||; orders refusal outcomes at Spearman >0.83 but fails incremental R² criterion (0.026) in anchor
   - **Gradient-blind fraction (GBF)**: Share of optimizer candidate pairs where objective moves less than noise; 47% in Gemma low-C region
   - **Threshold blindness (TBF)**: 1.0 in both models—keyword floor above selection threshold
   - **PARTIAL compliance**: Caveat-laden responses that fire keyword markers but aren't full refusals
   - **Surrogacy gap**: R²*(EN→EN) - R²*(EN→SL)
   - **NF4 quantization**: 4-bit NormalFloat used throughout; bf16 attenuates gap by ~0.15
   - **Judge-sensitivity**: 40/211 gap claims JUDGE_SENSITIVE, 105 DEFINITION_SENSITIVE

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`paper_draft.md`** (97,576 bytes, 932 lines after all edits)
     - The primary output file. Was overwritten from the `<previous_report>` markdown content (not the old LaTeX version), then extensively edited.
     - Structure: # title, ## Framing, ## Iteration 1 (with restored content), ## Iteration 2, ## Iteration 3, ## Iteration 4 (new), ## What we have learned so far (updated), ## References (updated with [19]-[22])
     - Key corrections applied (all marked [Correction, iter 4]):
       - Restored iteration-1 tables: same-edit response surface, sibling-surface guard, swap tests, transfer matrix, double dissociation, dead ends, iteration-1 assessment
       - Made band-mass regression model-specific (SL coefficient +0.156 CI [-0.240, 0.529] not significant)
       - Rewrote exp11 interpretation: dose not placement at operating point; miscalibration is primary finding; added miscalibration table
       - Fixed classifier kappa 0.858 [0.820, 0.888] (not 0.924), features are "char/word TF-IDF + hand features on first 100 tokens" (not "first-64-token embeddings")
       - Fixed eligible-row count (7 not 8), dead-end ledger count (16 not 20)
       - Restated surviving claim bounded by optimization strength (dose-scaling closes gap; bf16 200-trial reaches 3/100)
       - Fixed pasted_content tag leaks at lines 98/101
     - Iteration 4 section includes: Experiment 13 (Gemma overlap instrument, FALSIFIED on primary criterion), Experiment 14 (GaMS3 write profile, PARTIAL), Experiment 15 (scorer blindness, primary FALSIFIED), Evaluation 2 (audit, judge calibration, C3 curves, NF4 confound), Research 1 (novelty positioning)

   - **`.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json`** (11,914 bytes)
     - Structured output with title, abstract (1534 chars), summary (1325 chars), 8 figure specs, out_expected_files
     - Figure IDs: fig_behaviour_summary, fig_redundancy_index, fig_band_analysis, fig_cross_model, fig_refusal_gap, fig_write_profile, fig_gams3_profile, fig_gbf
     - MISSING: fig_dose_response spec (marker exists in paper at line 303 from iteration 2 content)

   - **`domain_terms.json`** — Updated with 6 new iteration-4 terms: causal write profile, write-mass overlap, gradient-blind fraction, threshold blindness, range compression ratio, matched-energy placement contrast

   - **`references.bib`** — Already had 22 entries from BibTeX fetch in previous session. References [19]-[22] added to paper: Li2024, Bosco2026, Jiang2026, Zhu2024

   - **`.aii/manifest.yaml`** — Created with step, iteration, title, description, output_files

   - **`README.md`** — Created with key files list, iteration 4 artifacts, corrections applied

   - **Artifact data read in this session:**
     - Experiment 13: results/report_tables.md (read in previous session per summary)
     - Experiment 14: results/report_tables.md (read in previous session)
     - Experiment 15: results/analysis.json, reselection_table.csv (read in previous session)
     - Evaluation 2: judge_calibration.json, flip_analysis.json, curve_fits.json (C3 verdict extracted), quant_confound.json, asr_summary.json, corrected_numbers_iter4.json (102 numbers, 97 match, 3 misdescribed, 2 mismatch), pending_human_review_iter4.md (5 files, 640 items pending), audit_log_iter4.json
     - Research 1: positioning_positive.md, positioning_negative.md (read in previous session)
     - Iteration-1 original report: iter_1/gen_report_text/gen_report_text/report.md (261 lines, full content read)

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **Edit string mismatch on exp11 paragraph**: The old_string had "EN refusal level achieves comparable gap reduction (+0.33), suggesting..." but the actual file had "EN refusal level achieves comparable gap reduction, suggesting..." (no number inline). Fixed by re-reading the file at the right offset and using the exact text.
   - **pasted_content tag leak**: Lines 98 and 101 contained `</pasted_content id="ac57">` and `<pasted_content id="ac57">` XML tags from the original prompt's text wrapping. Fixed by editing to remove the tags and join the split text ("Quality con" + "trol was automated only").
   - **Missing fig_dose_response figure spec**: The paper has `[FIGURE:fig_dose_response]` at line 303 (from iteration 2 content) but no matching figure spec in the JSON output. This was discovered in final verification and NOT YET FIXED.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully extracted the `<previous_report>` content (66,843 chars) from the original prompt stored in the JSONL transcript file
   - Successfully extracted all 9 MUST-FIX reviewer items from the transcript
   - Successfully extracted the JSON output schema and TODO list from the transcript
   - Identified that the existing paper_draft.md was in LaTeX format but the internal report format should be markdown with # headings — replaced with the correct format from `<previous_report>`
   - Applied 6 of 9 MUST-FIX items directly. Items #3 (5 iteration-2 interpretation fixes), #5 (caveats to iteration-3), #6 (file-path citations throughout), #7 (attack-success table, language consistency columns, item-level flip analysis added to earlier sections) were partially addressed through iteration 4 content but not fully applied as inline corrections to earlier sections

6. All User Messages:
   - Message 1 (continuation context): System summary of previous conversation providing detailed context about the task, artifacts, data extracted, and pending work.
   - Message 2 (the only actual user content, embedded in the pipeline prompt): "i want a reproducible bilingual study of refusal suppression in google/gemma-3-12b-it and cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct, with room for a genuine scientific discovery..."
   - No additional user messages were received during this session. All other content was tool results or system reminders.

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Add fig_dose_response figure spec** to `.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json` — the marker exists in the paper at line 303 (iteration 2 dose-response section) but has no matching figure spec in the JSON output
   - **Remaining MUST-FIX corrections not fully applied inline:**
     - MUST-FIX #3: 5 iteration-2 interpretations that contradict their tables (probe recovery, harm signal claim, dose-response marker-rule issue, mixed-judge repair table, reverse-direction analysis)
     - MUST-FIX #5: Add caveats to each iteration-3 section (exp9 Holm adjustment, exp10 EN judge agreement 0.54, exp12 judge gate miss 0.683)
     - MUST-FIX #6: Add file-path citations to table captions and inline numbers throughout (currently zero output-path citations)
     - MUST-FIX #7: Add attack-success table for all checkpoints, per-cell language-consistency columns, item-level flip analysis to earlier sections
     - MUST-FIX #8: Position novelty against depth-selection work more explicitly in earlier sections
   - **Terminology sweep**: Run over the finished draft to check all recurring technical nouns against domain_terms.json and references.bib

8. Current Work:
   I was in the final verification phase. I had just completed:
   - Writing the full paper_draft.md (97,576 bytes, 932 lines) with carried-forward text, corrections, and appended Iteration 4
   - Writing the structured JSON output (.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json) with 8 figure specs
   - Writing README.md and .aii/manifest.yaml
   - Verifying all output files exist and are valid
   - Finding two issues in final verification:
     1. pasted_content tags leaked (FIXED)
     2. fig_dose_response marker has no matching figure spec in JSON (NOT YET FIXED)
   
   The last thing I was doing was checking line 303 of paper_draft.md to understand the context of `[FIGURE:fig_dose_response]` — it's in the iteration 2 dose-response section (T12: Edit-strength dose-response) showing how scaling the LoRA edit affects EN vs SL refusal.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Add the missing `fig_dose_response` figure spec to `.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json`. The marker is at line 303 in the iteration-2 dose-response section. The figure should show dose-response curves for both models (GaMS3 and Gemma) with scaling factors 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 vs EN and SL refusal rates. Data is in the table at lines 289-299 of paper_draft.md. After that, apply the remaining MUST-FIX corrections that were not yet applied inline (#3, #5, #6, #7, #8), and run the terminology sweep.

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /root/.claude/projects/-ai-inventor-aii-data-runs-run-Fapgmt6JWbcD-3-invention-loop-iter-4-gen-report-text-gen-report-text/e2bdb1a5-a4da-4e49-b634-ef9f7b3b0b70.jsonl
Continue the conversation from where it left off without asking the user any further questions. Resume directly — do not acknowledge the summary, do not recap what was happening, do not preface with "I'll continue" or similar. Pick up the last task as if the break never happened.

<style_check>
The draft was measured against the <writing_register> in your prompt and trips it:

- 14.8 em dashes per 1,000 words; the limit is 3. Replace them with commas, colons or full stops.

Revise the PROSE of the draft in `./paper_draft.md` to fix each point, then emit the structured output again. Numbers, claims, citations, [FIGURE:...] markers and [ARTIFACT:...] markers stay exactly as they are; do not add content and do not change results. The figures array is unchanged.

<CRITICAL_ERROR>
The module-end file check FAILED (attempt 1/3).

PROBLEMS:
  - .aii/manifest.yaml has no top-level 'entries:' list

FIX IT:
1. Add one entry per uncovered path to `.aii/manifest.yaml` (create it if missing).
   Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve inside it. Globs and
   whole directories are fine — a whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry.

   entries:
     - path: results/
       keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible in this run
     - path: hf_cache/
       delete: redownloadable
       source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
     - path: checkpoints/
       delete: regenerable
       source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3"

   `keep:` takes a one-line reason. `delete:` takes `redownloadable` or
   `regenerable` and a `source:` that brings the files back.
2. Make sure `README.md` reads like a GitHub repository README: what you did,
   the layout (a line per important file/dir), how to run it, and a
   "Restoring removed files" section with the command for EVERY delete entry.
3. Text and code files never need a decision, and neither does anything under
   the auto-keep floor. Only large binaries and cache directories do.
