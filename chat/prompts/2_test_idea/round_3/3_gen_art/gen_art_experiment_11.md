### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-24 08:03:40 UTC

```
i want a reproducible bilingual study of refusal suppression in google/gemma-3-12b-it and cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct, with room for a genuine scientific discovery. compare each original model with one Heretic-abliterated version, evaluating all four checkpoints in English and Slovene. establish the safety–utility trade-offs, then investigate what explains them internally.

the attached research plan defines the intended study and supplies literature leads. verify its factual claims and references. this prompt governs execution: keep the core comparison fixed, but choose the mechanistic methods and discovery direction yourself. do not assume the expected findings are true.

Gemma-IT is a same-family, same-size aligned reference, not the direct training parent of GaMS-Instruct. endpoint differences cannot establish what Slovene continual pretraining, instruction tuning, or the small safety-training set caused.

step 1 - explore and establish feasibility. load both original models, pin revisions, verify their official tokenizers and chat templates, and inspect behavior and activations on a small development set in both languages. check coherent output, baseline refusal, and hidden-state extraction. use text-only inputs and comparable precision and inference settings; record unavoidable differences. inspect where the models behave similarly and where they differ, without committing to a mechanism. estimate the compute needed before scaling up. use separate smoke-test data and keep final evaluation untouched. if an edit fails or destroys language ability, investigate and report the failure rather than quietly substituting another model or calling incoherence successful refusal suppression.

step 2 - find the scientific opening. develop 5–7 distinct, falsifiable explanations or research directions from the pilot and the literature. search beyond refusal-vector papers, including multilingual representations, decision calibration, causal intervention, and capability interference. actively try to disprove novelty by reading the closest primary sources. select one or two promising directions for deeper experiments.

possible starting points: does cross-language intervention transfer depend on something that direction cosine misses? can we distinguish loss of harmfulness information from a changed mapping between that information and refusal? does interference with language-relevant computation explain different utility costs? these are suggestions, not required findings or an exhaustive menu. replace them if the evidence points somewhere better.

for each selected hypothesis, state its prediction, strongest competing explanation, simplest baseline, and a result that would falsify it. discovering that familiar geometry fails to predict behavior can be valuable if you establish its boundary. merely applying Heretic to GaMS, observing EN–SL vector similarity, or finding separable harmfulness after refusal declines is insufficient by itself as a novelty claim. if an exploratory hypothesis fails the novelty check, replace that hypothesis while preserving the core study.

step 3 - freeze the data and intervention protocol. separate Heretic construction/optimization data, mechanistic development data, held-out mechanistic validation, and final behavioral evaluation. keep translations, paraphrases, and harmful/harmless counterparts from the same semantic source together when splitting. audit overlap by source and meaning, not only exact strings. Heretic's default sources and Semantic-Harmful/Semantic-Harmless may overlap; those pairs cannot automatically serve as independent validation.

create one main Heretic checkpoint per original model using the same pinned version, English prompt source, comparable objectives, and equal search budgets. choose checkpoints by a declared development-only rule balancing refusal reduction and harmless divergence. evaluate that same English-derived edit in both languages. a community Gemma edit is a sanity reference, not a substitute for the matched main intervention. record configurations, seeds, selected trials, precision, and checkpoint hashes. distinguish differences in achieved optimization from intrinsic model properties. additional seeds or edit strengths may support a focused robustness analysis, but keep them separate from the four core checkpoints.

step 4 - measure behavior and utility. use the official NASK-PIB/RefusEU evaluation data for English and Slovene, following its published scoring protocol where reproducible. report harmful compliance/attack success, refusal, and language consistency separately. refusal and harmful compliance are not complements: ambiguous, irrelevant, malformed, and empty outputs need explicit treatment. include a small independent benign safety-adjacent set to measure over-refusal. a model that refuses everything, or cannot answer coherently, must not look successful.

use the same frozen judge and rubric across conditions, with model identity hidden. check scoring sensitivity using a second independent judge on a stratified sample. prepare a blinded EN/SL sample for human review; if qualified human review is unavailable, mark it pending and state the limitation instead of claiming it happened.

for utility, use Slovenian LLM Eval and the corresponding English tasks: ARC-Challenge, BoolQ, HellaSwag, OpenBookQA, PIQA, and Winogrande. report individual tasks and their macro-average, emphasizing original-to-edited changes within each language. also measure harmless divergence on held-out inputs, wrong-language output, repetition, and output validity. Heretic's optimization KL alone is not independent evidence of preserved utility.

do not assume RefusEU examples sharing an ID are exact translations, or that EN and SL benchmark difficulty is identical. verify correspondence before making paired cross-language claims. use a separate faithful EN/SL contrast set for controlled language comparisons. translate only missing material, preserve semantic IDs, document translation checks, and distinguish automated checks from native-speaker review. published model-card scores are context and sanity checks; measure the four checkpoints yourself under the same protocol.

step 5 - connect representations to behavior. complete the mechanistic core: layer-wise bilingual harmful/harmless direction characterization in both originals, and held-out harmfulness separability before and after Heretic. choose and justify activation locations and token positions. select layers, probes, and hyperparameters on development data only.

control for topic, wording, prompt length, language identity, and response leakage. decoding harmfulness from generated refusal text is not evidence that a pre-response harmfulness signal drives refusal. compare a frozen original-model probe with appropriately cross-validated probes refitted after editing where useful: failure of the frozen probe can reflect representation drift rather than information loss. do not interpret raw cross-model vector cosine as shared mechanism without establishing comparable coordinates.

relate internal measurements to actual behavioral changes in each language. high probe accuracy establishes decodability, not causal use. a harmful-minus-harmless direction is only refusal-associated until interventions support a stronger interpretation. changes in a direction directly targeted by Heretic are expected and cannot alone carry the discovery.

step 6 - pursue the strongest explanation. use the freedom from step 2 to design the smallest decisive experiment. where justified, extract EN- and SL-derived directions and test the source-language × evaluation-language transfer matrix within each model. choose intervention locations and strengths on development data, and include no-op and matched random-direction controls plus benign utility checks. keep these activation interventions separate from the main Heretic comparison.

you may instead pursue subspaces, layer-specific interventions, representation-to-action coupling, or another approach supported by the pilot. the goal is a result that distinguishes competing explanations and predicts something on untouched data. use held-out semantic categories or an independent prompt source to challenge it. explain what survives, what breaks, and where the claim stops. prefer one well-tested insight over a large collection of loosely connected metrics. preserve the behavioral and mechanistic core even if every novelty candidate fails.

step 7 - test the claims honestly. freeze primary outcomes and confirmatory analyses before final evaluation. report original-to-edited effects for each model and language, with effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals. compare those changes across models and languages without attributing them to a specific training stage.

state the resampling and aggregation units. pair outputs on the same prompts and cluster translations/paraphrases by underlying semantic item; use cross-language pairing only where correspondence is established. four checkpoints, many layers, or many prompts do not create many independent model families. prompt-level uncertainty also does not measure variation across Heretic optimization runs. account for searching across hypotheses and layers, separate exploratory from confirmatory results, and state when sample sizes cannot resolve a difference. if resources require subsampling, freeze a stratified sample before viewing results and narrow the claims accordingly.

bonus - examine cjvt/GaMS3-12B as a bounded pre-instruction diagnostic. test harmfulness separability and a small EN/SL behavior sample with appropriate base-model formatting. do not compare its raw refusal rate with chat models as if the tasks were identical. only attempt base abliteration if refusal-like behavior is reproducible, the intervention has an interpretable target, and it does not jeopardize the main study. intermediate training checkpoints and no-safety training controls belong to a later extension unless already available.

deliver a reproducible repository and a paper grounded in executed experiments: pinned dependencies, split manifests, configurations, per-example outputs and scores, analysis scripts, and figures covering the four checkpoints in both languages. distinguish observations, interpretations, failed hypotheses, and unexecuted proposals. recompute every headline number from saved results and reconcile the abstract, tables, figures, and conclusions after the final audit. the discovery may change as evidence accumulates; the final paper must reflect the strongest claim that actually survives.

name: aii-python
description: "Applies this repo's Python conventions to experiment and evaluation scripts: uv-only environment setup (never pip), loguru logging with stdout plus a rotating file sink, @logger.catch(reraise=True) with explicit exception types, pathlib file access, type hints, and a standard main() script skeleton. ALWAYS read before writing or editing any Python script that runs an experiment, evaluation, or data-processing job. Triggers: writing or refactoring a Python script, uv venv, uv pip install, pyproject dependencies, loguru, logging setup, try/except and error handling, pathlib, script structure, Python 3.12. NOT for: parallelism, GPU throughput or hardware sizing (use aii-parallel-computing and aii-use-hardware), scaling long autonomous jobs (use aii-long-running-tasks), splitting oversized output files (use aii-file-size-limit), calling LLMs (use aii-openrouter-llms), or notebooks meant for Colab (use aii-colab)."
---

## Environment Setup

- Python 3.12+
- **NEVER use `pip` or `.venv/bin/pip`** — they are not installed. Use `uv` for ALL package operations:
  ```bash
  uv venv .venv --python=3.12
  source .venv/bin/activate  # or: .venv/bin/python script.py
  uv pip install pandas loguru  # NOT: pip install
  ```
- Create `.toml` file with dependencies, create uv `.venv` and activate it
- NO inline dependencies (no `# /// script` headers)

## Logging

Use `loguru` for all logging. Add a file sink alongside stdout.

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove()  # Remove default handler
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")
```

Rules:
- Log every major step (data loading, processing start/end, results)
- If applicable, log every LLM API call input and output
- Truncate long outputs in logs (add truncation logic for potentially large strings)
- Use `logger.error()` in except blocks (traceback auto-captured)

## Error Handling

- Wrap major operations in try/except blocks
- Use `@logger.catch(reraise=True)` decorator on main functions — without `reraise=True`, the script exits 0 even on uncaught exceptions, hiding failures from downstream consumers
- Use explicit exception types, not bare `except:`
- Never silently swallow exceptions — always log them

```python
@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    try:
        data = load_data(path)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error("Data file not found")
        raise
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logger.error("Invalid JSON in data file")
        raise
```

## Code Structure

- Use `pathlib.Path` for file operations: `Path("data/input.json").read_text()` not `open(...).read()`
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Use keyword arguments for functions with more than 4 parameters
- No hardcoded paths — derive from script location or accept as arguments

## Script Pattern

Standard pattern for experiment/evaluation scripts:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Brief description of what this script does."""

from loguru import logger
from pathlib import Path
import json
import sys

logger.remove()
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")

@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    # Load data
    data_path = Path("full_data_out.json")
    logger.info(f"Loading data from {data_path}")
    data = json.loads(data_path.read_text())
    logger.info(f"Loaded {len(data['examples'])} examples")

    # Process
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(data["examples"]):
        try:
            result = process(example)
            results.append(result)
        except Exception:
            logger.error(f"Failed on example {i}")
            continue

    # Save output
    output = {"examples": results}
    Path("method_out.json").write_text(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
    logger.info(f"Saved {len(results)} results")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

name: aii-long-running-tasks
description: "Scales an experiment or evaluation up in stages — mini, 10, 50, 100, 200, then the largest run that fits — recording runtime at each step and extrapolating time-per-example against the remaining time budget before growing further, with background execution and hard RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_CPU caps. ALWAYS read before launching any script expected to run for many minutes or hours over a dataset. Triggers: long-running job, overnight or unattended run, time budget, how many examples fit, extrapolate runtime, start small then scale up, run in background and poll, avoid a timeout, full-dataset evaluation, resource limits. NOT for choosing the concurrency mechanism itself (aii-parallel-computing), measuring the machine's CPU, RAM or GPU (aii-use-hardware), or provisioning cloud pods (aii-runpod)."
---

## Core Principles

1. **Time budget first**: Read your time/runtime constraints before running anything. Set every Bash timeout to fit within the budget.
2. **Start small, scale up**: Run on minimal input first, fix errors, then increase scale.
3. **Extrapolate before scaling**: Use recorded runtimes to predict whether the next step fits in the budget. Don't guess — calculate.
4. **Background execution**: For anything that takes >1 min, run in background (`run_in_background=true`) and do useful work while waiting.
5. **Stop early if needed**: Quality results on less data beats a timeout or crash. It's always acceptable to stop at a smaller scale.

---

## Gradual Scaling Sequence

Run code at increasing data sizes, checking runtime at each step.

Substitute your actual file names:
- `{mini_file}` — mini JSON (3 examples) from dependency workspace
- `{full_file}` — full dataset from dependency workspace
- `{script}` — your processing script (e.g., `./method.py`, `./eval.py`)
- `{schema}` — JSON schema to validate output against

**STEP 1 — MINI DATA:** Run `{script}` on `{mini_file}`. Do NOT truncate logs. Fix all errors. Validate output against `{schema}`. Verify you are NOT using mock scripts, mock data, or mock APIs.

**STEP 2 — 10 EXAMPLES:** Modify `{script}` to load only the first 10 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Validate schema. Record the runtime.

**STEP 3 — 50 EXAMPLES:** Load first 50 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. **EXTRAPOLATE**: Using runtimes from steps 2-3, estimate time per example. Calculate how many examples fit in your remaining time budget. If 50 already used most of the budget, stop here.

**STEP 4 — 100 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 100 examples. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. Re-extrapolate with the new data point.

**STEP 5 — 200 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 200 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime.

**STEP 6 — MAXIMIZE:** Using all recorded runtimes, extrapolate time-per-example (it may not be perfectly linear — account for overhead). Calculate the maximum number of examples that fits within your remaining time budget with a 10% safety margin. Load that many (or all if they fit). Run and validate.

## Final Testing Phase

After completing the scaling sequence, redo the entire sequence **one more time** up to your final example count:

mini → 10 → 50 → 100 → 200 → max

At each scale: look for issues, fix problems, validate output, ensure it completes within time limits.

---

## Background Execution

For any step that takes >1 min, run as a **background task**:

1. Launch with Bash `run_in_background=true`
2. While it runs, use the time productively:
   - Sanity-check previous outputs
   - Verify file integrity (correct field names, non-empty values)
   - Review code for edge cases at larger scale
   - Prepare the next step
3. Check back on the background task to get results
4. If it failed, fix errors and re-run

---

## Resource Limits

Set hard RAM and CPU time limits so code fails fast instead of crashing the system. Read limits from `<hardware>` and leave headroom for the OS (e.g., if 16GB total, cap at 14GB).

Python example using stdlib `resource` module:
```python
import resource
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (14 * 1024**3, 14 * 1024**3))  # 14GB RAM
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (3600, 3600))  # 1 hour CPU time
```
Exceeding RAM raises `MemoryError`. Exceeding CPU time sends `SIGKILL`.

## Monitoring

At each step, record runtime AND check resource usage (`free -h` for RAM, `top -bn1 | head -5` for CPU). If memory usage is climbing toward the limit or CPU is pegged, stop and investigate before scaling further.

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --format {1} --file {2}' ::: 'exp_sel_data_out' 'exp_gen_sol_out' 'exp_eval_sol_out' :::+ '/tmp/full_data_out.json' '/tmp/method_out.json' '/tmp/eval_out.json'
```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Experiment Pipeline** — the four formats `schemas/` actually holds and
`AVAILABLE_FORMATS` in `scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py` accepts (this
list used to name six hypothesis-selection schemas that exist nowhere and
omit the proof one; corrected 2026-09-03):
- `exp_sel_data_out.json` - Experiment Data Selection format
- `exp_gen_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Generation format
- `exp_eval_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Evaluation format
- `exp_proof_out.json` - Experiment Proof format

---

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

ALWAYS run right after a script writes JSON output, and whenever a file is too big to keep, exceeds a stated file size limit, or gets rejected for its size. Triggers: file too large, output exceeds the size limit, oversized or huge JSON, ls -lh size check after generating results, splitting or chunking an output file into parts, output directory instead of one file. NOT for: schema validation or making mini and preview variants of a file already within the limit (use aii-json), or general Python script conventions (use aii-python)."
---

## File Size Check

After generating output files, run `ls -lh` to check sizes. If ANY file exceeds the provided file size limit:

1. Create directory with same base name (e.g., `full_data_out/` for `full_data_out.json`)
2. Split into parts under the limit named: `full_data_out_1.json`, `full_data_out_2.json`, etc.
3. Place parts in directory (e.g., `full_data_out/full_data_out_1.json`, `full_data_out/full_data_out_2.json`)
4. Delete the original oversized file
5. Update the script to read from split files: `for f in sorted(glob.glob('full_data_out/full_data_out_*.json')): data.extend(json.load(open(f)))`
6. For each split part, generate its own mini/preview versions with the json skill's format script

Triggers: how much RAM or CPU or GPU is available, container memory limit, cgroup, OOM killed, MemoryError, os.cpu_count reports host cores, nproc, VRAM, CUDA available, CPU-only torch build, dataset too big for memory, chunking.

---

**Step 1** — Run `bash scripts/get_hardware.sh` (relative to this skill's directory).

Read the `=== CGROUP ===` section carefully. If `Type: cgroup v1` or `cgroup v2`:
- You are in a **container with hard resource limits**. Exceeding them = OOM kill, no recovery.
- **Never** use `psutil.virtual_memory().total`, `free -h`, `/proc/meminfo`, `os.cpu_count()`, or `nproc` for resource limits — these report **host** values, not your container's allocation.
- **Always** read limits from the cgroup paths shown in the output, or use the Python helpers below.
- For **runtime memory monitoring**, read current usage from cgroup too:
  - v2: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.current`
  - v1: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.usage_in_bytes`

**Step 2** — Use Step 1 results to pick package variants **before** installing.

Defaults often target the most powerful environment — PyPI's `torch` ships with CUDA libs even on CPU-only hosts. Wrong variant = wasted disk, slow setup, possible import-time failures.

If `=== GPU ===` shows `No GPU`, install torch's CPU build (skips ~4.5GB of CUDA libs):
```bash
uv pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
Same idea for any library whose wheel selection depends on detected hardware (GPU/CPU-only builds, architecture-specific wheels).

After install, sanity-check imports right away (`python -c "import torch"`). Disk-pressure or interrupted installs leave half-built wheels (e.g. `libtorch_global_deps.so` missing) — catch these before the experiment runs.

**Step 3** — Set Python constants from the Step 1 results:
```python
import os, math, torch, psutil
from pathlib import Path

def _detect_cpus() -> int:
    """Detect actual CPU allocation (containers/pods/bare metal)."""
    try:  # cgroups v2 quota
        parts = Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max").read_text().split()
        if parts[0] != "max":
            return math.ceil(int(parts[0]) / int(parts[1]))
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # cgroups v1 quota
        q = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us").read_text())
        p = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_period_us").read_text())
        if q > 0:
            return math.ceil(q / p)
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # CPU affinity (cpuset — used by RunPod, Docker --cpuset-cpus)
        return len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))
    except (AttributeError, OSError): pass
    return os.cpu_count() or 1

def _container_ram_gb() -> float | None:
    """Read RAM limit from cgroup (containers/pods)."""
    for p in ["/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max", "/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes"]:
        try:
            v = Path(p).read_text().strip()
            if v != "max" and int(v) < 1_000_000_000_000:
                return int(v) / 1e9
        except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    return None

NUM_CPUS = _detect_cpus()
HAS_GPU = torch.cuda.is_available()
VRAM_GB = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_mem / 1e9 if HAS_GPU else 0
DEVICE = torch.device("cuda" if HAS_GPU else "cpu")
TOTAL_RAM_GB = _container_ram_gb() or psutil.virtual_memory().total / 1e9
AVAILABLE_RAM_GB = min(psutil.virtual_memory().available / 1e9, TOTAL_RAM_GB)
```

## Step 4 — Set Memory Limits

OOM kills the entire container. **Every script MUST set RAM and VRAM limits at startup.**

Decide the budget based on what the script actually needs. Estimate data size × 2-5x for in-memory overhead, then add ~50% breathing room for temporaries. You may use up to 90% of available RAM/VRAM, but **scale gradually** — start small (e.g. 30-50%), verify it works, then increase toward the limit. Never exceed 90% to keep a buffer for the OS, system processes, and the agent runtime itself. Going over crashes the container/machine with no recovery.

```python
import resource, psutil

_avail = psutil.virtual_memory().available
RAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate what this script needs (in bytes)
assert RAM_BUDGET < _avail, f"Budget {RAM_BUDGET/1e9:.1f}GB > available {_avail/1e9:.1f}GB"
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (RAM_BUDGET * 3, RAM_BUDGET * 3))  # 3x: virtual > RSS; raises MemoryError on exceed

if HAS_GPU:
    _free, _total = torch.cuda.mem_get_info(0)
    VRAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate GPU memory needs
    torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(min(VRAM_BUDGET / _total, 0.95))  # raises OutOfMemoryError on exceed
```

## Memory-Safe Data Processing

- **One at a time**: load one large object → process → `del obj; gc.collect()` → next
- **Load only what you need**: select specific tables/columns/rows, not entire databases
- **Test small first**: run on a sample before scaling to full data to estimate memory/time
- **Free intermediates in loops**: don't accumulate large results — aggregate incrementally
- **Size before loading**: check file/dataset size before loading; if it's >30% of `RAM_BUDGET`, chunk it

## Common Mistakes (from real crashes)

- **Skipping this skill entirely** — loading data with no RAM detection, no limits, no budget. Container OOM-killed, all agents lost.
- **Using `psutil.virtual_memory().total` instead of `_container_ram_gb()`** — reports host RAM (e.g. 66 GB) when container limit is 28 GB. You MUST use the cgroup-aware functions above.
- **Loading all tables from a multi-table database at once** — one agent loaded 14 RelBench tables simultaneously, spiked past container limit.
- **Setting no memory limits** — without `resource.setrlimit` (RAM) and `set_per_process_memory_fraction` (VRAM), a runaway script OOM-kills the container instead of raising a catchable error.
- **Using `os.cpu_count()` directly** — returns host CPUs (e.g. 192) instead of container limit (e.g. 4) on RunPod/Docker. Always use `_detect_cpus()` above which checks cgroup quota → CPU affinity → `os.cpu_count()` in order.

## Hardware Use

- Keep these results in mind for ALL subsequent tasks — don't assume more than detected
- GPU if available and parallelizable, multiprocessing if multiple CPUs
- Push available resources to their full potential — don't leave hardware idle

---

**ALWAYS parallelize. Sequential processing is unacceptable for any non-trivial workload.** A sequential script doing 1000 API calls takes hours and fails halfway. An async version finishes in minutes with proper error handling. ALWAYS ask: "Can this run in parallel?" — the answer is almost always yes.

Read aii-use-hardware skill first → get `NUM_CPUS`, `HAS_GPU`, `VRAM_GB`, `device`. Set `NUM_WORKERS` proportional to available CPU capacity — check `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)` and scale accordingly (e.g. 30% used → use ~70% of cores).

## Decision Tree (follow strictly)

- **I/O-bound** (API calls, downloads, web, file reads) → `asyncio` + `aiohttp` with `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`. NEVER do sequential HTTP requests in a loop.
- **CPU-bound, vectorizable** → GPU available: PyTorch on device / No GPU: NumPy vectorized ops. NEVER loop over array elements in Python.
- **CPU-bound, independent items** → `ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=NUM_WORKERS)`. NEVER process items one-by-one when they're independent.
- **Sequential** → only acceptable when items have data dependencies (each depends on the previous result).

## GPU Rules

- Use up to 90% of available VRAM — scale gradually (start small, increase after each successful run, keep 10% buffer)
- Move to device → compute → move back: `torch.tensor(data, device=device)` → `.cpu().numpy()`
- OOM fallback: catch `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` → `empty_cache()` → halve batch size → retry on GPU. Keep reducing until it fits. Stay on GPU.
- Batch large data: chunk it, `del batch` between iterations to free VRAM

## Parallelism Rules

- **CPU-bound**: `ProcessPoolExecutor` + `as_completed`, pre-allocate result list indexed by submission order
- **I/O-bound**: `asyncio` + `aiohttp`, `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`, single shared `ClientSession`, `asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)`
- Always add `tenacity` retries for transient failures, always set timeouts on HTTP requests
- **CRITICAL — `ProcessPoolExecutor` start method**: Default `fork` deadlocks with loguru (and any threading library). ALWAYS pass `mp_context=multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")` when constructing `ProcessPoolExecutor` in any script that uses loguru, threading, or async I/O. Example:
  ```python
  import multiprocessing as mp
  from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
  with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=N, mp_context=mp.get_context("spawn")) as pool:
      ...
  ```

# Mechanistic interpretability — field handbook

## Overview

Scope: the FIELD of mechanistic interpretability — what a mechanistic claim is, how it is
validated, and where the frontier sits mid-2026. The star is the SUBSTRATE below: a dated,
source-anchored map with an explicit do-not-redo list. The only lens is open questions.
This is the SOLE interpretability handbook: SAE-era decomposition
primitives are covered here as one thread of six rather than in a separate deep-dive.

## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)

- The field defines itself by **goal, not method**: understand computational mechanisms "in order
  to accomplish concrete scientific and engineering goals" [S1].
- Its own venue prints a **two-track evidence bar**: either "specific falsifiable hypotheses, and
  how the evidence provided does and does not support them", or "clear practical benefits over
  well-implemented baselines" [S14].
- One methodological critique reframes findings as **statistical estimates, not properties**: the
  causal effect of a component is "a volatile random variable rather than a fixed property" [S4].
- **Structure is not mechanism.** Discovery algorithms "sample from an equivalence class of valid
  subgraphs rather than recovering a unique mechanism" [S23].
- **Causal abstraction is vacuous without an encoding assumption**: with unrestricted alignment maps,
  "any neural network can be mapped to any algorithm" [S5].
- The artifact a reader gets is a **hypothesis about the model, not a description of it** —
  attribution graphs (Anthropic) run on a replacement model and give satisfying insight on about
  "a quarter of the prompts" [S11].

## Frontier (recency-weighted)

**Validity & stability of the method itself** *(weight-capped — the loudest thread)*

- Circuit discovery is unstable under small perturbations: "small perturbations in input data
  or hyperparameters yield vastly different circuits" [S4] (2025-10, rev 2026-05).
- Phantom specialization: across 75 circuits in five Pythia models, structural differences showed
  "apparent specialization but do not correspond to functional differences" [S23] (2026-06).
- The workhorse approximation was diagnosed — attribution patching's "dominant error stems from the
  non-linearities in the downstream network rather than local curvature at the patched component",
  with a correction in the same paper [S19] (2026-06).

**Intrinsic interpretability (train-for-interpretability)**

- Weight-sparse transformers yield understandable circuits, but "making weights sparser trades off
  capability for interpretability", and "scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero
  parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge" [S18] (2025-11).
- The newest entrant flips the unit from behavior to parameter, asking "whether a single weight can
  be understood globally across the full training distribution" [S2] (2026-07, four models only).

**Evaluation & standardization**

- MIB is a standardized method-comparison benchmark: on causal variable localization "the supervised DAS method
  performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons" [S10] (ICML 2025), extended to a
  community shared task whose framing admission stands — "measuring progress in MI remains
  challenging" [S22] (BlackboxNLP 2025).
- Randomized baselines invalidate the auto-interp proxy: SAEs on randomly initialized transformers
  score similarly to trained ones [S9] (2025-01, rev 2026-01).

**Decomposition primitives (the SAE era, and after)**

- The sparsity objective is itself a distorting inductive bias: feature absorption "is caused by
  optimizing for sparsity in SAEs whenever the underlying features form a hierarchy", so
  "SAE latents may be inherently unreliable classifiers" [S30] (NeurIPS 2025 Oral).
- The single latent is not a canonical unit — SAE stitching shows dictionaries are incomplete and
  meta-SAEs show they are "not atomic" [S33] (ICLR 2025); seed-unstable latents concentrate in
  "reproducible lower-rank subspaces", i.e. basis ambiguity rather than noise [S35] (2026-06).
- The raw-latent verdict a reviewer will cite: on steering "prompting outperforms all existing
  methods" and on detection difference-in-means wins — "SAEs are not competitive" [S31] (2025-01);
  contested, but only by an unreviewed supervised-pipeline rebuttal [S25].
- Proxy metrics are the field's own named weak point: "gains on proxy metrics do not reliably
  translate to better practical performance" [S32] (ICML 2025).
- Model diffing has a known-bad default: the crosscoder L1 loss "can misattribute concepts as unique
  to the fine-tuned model, when they really exist in both models"; the same paper ships the BatchTopK
  fix [S34] (NeurIPS 2025).
- The flagship open fleet has already moved past SAE-only — Gemma Scope 2 ships "transcoders,
  cross-layer transcoders, and crosscoders" alongside SAEs [S36] (2025-12).

**Reasoning-trace interpretability**

- Faithfulness and monitorability come apart: "models can appear faithful yet remain hard to
  monitor when they leave out key factors" [S12] (2025-10).
- The dominant unfaithfulness metric is contested — it "confuses unfaithfulness with
  incompleteness", and "the absence of hint words alone does not prove unfaithfulness" [S13]
  (2025-12, rev 2026-05).

**Applied / safety-facing interpretability**

- Persona vectors (Anthropic) predict and pre-empt training-induced trait shifts, and "flag training data that
  will produce undesirable personality changes" [S16] (2025-07) — the clearest applied win.
- A blinded audit protocol exists: three of four teams "successfully uncovered the model's hidden
  objective", SAEs among the techniques used [S17] (2025-03).
- Counter-current, and the sharpest 2026 negative result — internal decodability far exceeded output
  behaviour: "Linear probes discriminated hazardous from benign cases with 98.2% AUROC, yet the
  model's output sensitivity was only 45.1%, a 53-percentage-point knowledge-action gap." SAE
  feature steering "produced zero effect despite 3,695 significant features", and steering was
  "indistinguishable from random perturbation" [S3] (2026-03; 400 physician-adjudicated vignettes,
  one clinical domain).

**Field strategy & meta-science**

- A frontier lab publicly narrowed its bet — "We have been disappointed by the amount of progress
  made by ambitious mech interp work, from both us and others", and "We made a decision to
  deprioritise SAE research as a result, not because we thought the technique was useless" [S6]
  (2025-12). One team's decision, not a field verdict.
- Results are not yet comparable across papers: two studies reached "conflicting conclusions for the
  same behavior", a third found both "partially correct but incomparable" [S8] (2026-04).

## Recent (~1–2 yr, compressed) · Durable core

- The field's own review concedes "there are many open problems in the field that require solutions
  before many scientific and practical benefits can be realized" [S1] (2025-01), and the LRM sub-map
  names the same gaps [S24]. The two framings a reviewer will invoke: "the returns from
  interpretability have been roughly nonexistent" [S7] (2025-05), against "We are thus in a race
  between interpretability and model intelligence." [S15] (2025-04) — a stated goal, not a result.
- Durable: activation patching remains the gold-standard causal metric faster methods approximate [S19];
  attribution graphs remain the scaling story, with their stated ceiling [S11].

## ⛔ Already crowded — go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)

The blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:

- **Circuit-discovery methods and their corrections.** Attribution patching, its error diagnosis and
  second-order fix [S19], structural-vs-functional decoupling [S23], and an eight-method community
  bake-off [S22] are all published.
- **Auto-interp / agentic feature explanation.** Both the agentic pipeline [S21] and the
  randomized-baseline invalidation of its metrics [S9] already exist.
- **Activation steering and its reliability diagnostics.** Per-sample unreliability and the
  linear-approximation limit are characterized [S20]; the AxBench verdict
  already has a published rebuttal [S25].
- **CoT faithfulness / monitorability metrics.** The measurement wave [S12] and the
  metric-invalidating counter-wave [S13] have both landed.
- **Benchmarking MI methods against each other.** MIB [S10] plus its shared-task extension [S22]
  own this; a new leaderboard re-treads it.
- **Developmental / training-dynamics interpretability.** Feature evolution is already tracked
  across pre-training snapshots with crosscoders [S28] (ICLR 2026).
- **Training-data attribution as an interpretability method.** Already explicitly bridged to MI and
  causally validated on Pythia [S26].
- **Multimodal / vision-language mechanistic interpretability.** Has its own survey and taxonomy
  since 2025-02 [S27].
- **Mechanistic interpretability of RL-trained reasoning models.** Occupied through 2026 — temporal
  sparse autoencoders already track feature dynamics across RLVR training [S29].
- **Sparse-dictionary decomposition of activations.** The most-worked lane in the field: SAE features
  are "not better than neurons" on MIB [S10], the auto-interp metrics used to defend them fail a
  randomized baseline [S9], absorption is traced to the objective itself [S30], canonical-unit claims
  are refuted [S33], and the raw-latent steering/detection verdict plus its rebuttal are both
  published [S31] [S25].

> **Standing directive — this list is necessarily INCOMPLETE.** Map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,
> NOT *open*. Before committing to any direction this map does not explicitly flag as crowded, run
> a fresh, dated saturation search and confirm the space is actually unoccupied. (Measured in this forge's own

## Open questions the field hasn't answered

*(the whole lens — the reader answers in their own way)*

1. If exact single-input causal scores are volatile random variables [S4] and structurally distinct
   circuits implement one computation [S23], **what object is circuit discovery actually estimating,
   and at what granularity is a "mechanism" even well-defined?** The field's standard output — one
   circuit, one figure — presupposes an answer it has not given.
2. Causal abstraction is vacuous without a constraint on how models encode information [S5]. What
   would make such an encoding assumption testable independently of the claim it licenses?
3. Near-perfect internal decodability coexists with a large knowledge-action gap and steering
   indistinguishable from random perturbation [S3]. What would have to hold for "we understand it"
   to imply "we can change it" — and is that implication load-bearing for the field's stated
   goals [S1]?
4. Two verdicts clash: the returns are "roughly nonexistent" [S7], yet the same window produced
   deployed applied results [S16] [S17]. On what measure are both true, and which should a paper
   report?
5. Two studies reached conflicting conclusions on one behavior and a third found both partially
   right but incomparable [S8]. What makes two mechanistic findings comparable at all, and can that
   be settled without a standard the field does not yet have?
6. Interpretability is bought at a stated capability cost with a scaling ceiling [S18], while
   auto-interp scores fail to separate trained from random networks [S9]. What is the exchange rate
   between understandability and capability, and who should be willing to pay it?

## What counts as DEEP here (taste)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ship a new circuit/feature method that improves a proxy metric on one task. | The rewarded move meets the venue's own bar: state "specific falsifiable hypotheses, and how the evidence provided does and does not support them", or show "clear practical benefits over well-implemented baselines". Recognition signal: a NeurIPS 2025 **Spotlight** went to a result proving the field's own framework vacuous when generalized [S5]. | problematizes-nothing — proxy-metric progress reads incremental in 2026 | L·A | [S14] [S5] |
| Treat a high auto-interpretability or reconstruction score as evidence that real features were recovered. | **Buried (2025-01, rev 2026-01):** the same scores appear on randomly initialized transformers [S9]. Reopening condition, stated there: routine randomized baselines plus targeted measures of feature abstractness. | wrong-result — the metric does not discriminate the thing it is used to claim | L | [S9] |
| Report one circuit, from one extraction, one seed, one input distribution, as *the* mechanism. | **Buried (2025-10 → 2026-06):** effects are volatile random variables [S4]; structure-to-function is many-to-one [S23]. Reopening condition: edge-level evaluation plus cross-condition transfer tests. | wrong-result — a single-draw circuit is an unreported sample from an equivalence class | L | [S4] [S23] |

> **Science-vs-application, as this field draws it:** unusually, it prints BOTH bars in one
> sentence [S14] — a falsifiable mechanistic claim, or a demonstrated practical benefit over strong
> baselines. What clears neither is a method with a better proxy score and no falsifiable
> hypothesis attached [S9] [S22].

## Critical rules (execution · eval · validity)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Report a circuit from one seed/hyperparameter/input set. | Designing the run: sample across seeds, hyperparameters and input distributions; report the distribution and stability metrics, not the modal circuit. | wrong-result — single-config circuits are unstable | L | [S4] |
| Read structural difference between two circuits as two mechanisms. | Before claiming distinct mechanisms: run edge-level evaluation and cross-condition transfer; source-level evaluation inflates apparent faithfulness. | wrong-result — phantom specialization | L | [S23] |
| Use attribution patching scores as ground truth at scale. | When approximating: screen with a reliability score and correct the leading term; expect downstream non-linearity, not local curvature, to dominate the error. | wrong-result — the evidence for the circuit is itself misspecified | L | [S19] |
| Validate an interpretation with a freely-parameterized alignment map. | Stating the claim: fix and declare the map class, and make the encoding assumption explicit — unconstrained maps hit 100% interchange-intervention accuracy on randomly initialized models. | wrong-result — a perfect fit that means nothing | L | [S5] |
| Use a raw SAE latent as a classifier or steering target. | Choosing the unit: benchmark against difference-in-means and a prompting ceiling before claiming a latent works; expect absorption to make single latents unreliable where features are hierarchical. | wrong-result — the raw-latent verdict is the field's default prior | L | [S31] [S30] |
| Read a crosscoder model-diff at face value. | Diffing two models: use BatchTopK rather than L1 and presence-test any "unique to the fine-tune" latent — the artifact is a property of the loss. | wrong-result — the loss fabricates unique-to-finetune latents | L | [S34] |
| Score SAE/dictionary features against nothing. | Choosing the comparison: benchmark against non-featurized hidden vectors (neurons) and supervised DAS on MIB's tracks. | wrong-result — featurization may add zero | L | [S10] |
| Report auto-interp scores as the validity evidence. | Reporting: add a randomized-transformer arm; treat aggregate auto-interp as a proxy, never as recovery evidence. | wrong-result — untrained networks pass | L | [S9] |
| Claim a steering result from a mean effect at one coefficient. | Reporting steering: give the per-sample distribution and the behaviors where it fails; effect sizes "vary across samples and are unreliable for many target behaviors". | wrong-result — the mean hides the failure regime | L | [S20] |
| Call a CoT unfaithful because it omits a hint that changed the answer. | Judging traces: separate unfaithfulness from incompleteness, and pair hint-based metrics with causal mediation. | wrong-result — the metric over-reports | L | [S13] [S12] |
| Claim interpretability *enables* correction because the information is decodable. | Closing the loop: measure output-level correction AND collateral disruption of already-correct cases, against a random-perturbation control. | wrong-result — decodability ≠ actionability | L | [S3] |

## Decision guide

- **Which primitive for which question:** components and their interactions → circuit localization
  (attribution / mask optimization lead on MIB); an interpretable variable inside a hidden vector →
  causal variable localization (supervised DAS leads; SAE features do not beat neurons) [S10].
- **Post-hoc vs trained-for-interpretability:** post-hoc buys you the deployed model; weight-sparse
  training buys understandability at a capability cost and stops scaling in the tens of millions of
  nonzero parameters [S18].
- **Auditing claims:** in the reference blinded protocol, three of four teams succeeded, leaning on
  several technique families together rather than interpretability alone [S17].
- **Weighing sources:** most 2026 frontier results here are unreviewed preprints; the peer-reviewed
  anchors are [S5] (NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight), [S10] (ICML 2025), [S22] (BlackboxNLP 2025).

## Ground rules (known-lane — terse)

- Activation patching = the gold-standard causal metric; attribution patching = its first-order,
  gradient-based approximation, adopted for cost [S19].
- A "circuit" is a subgraph claimed to explain a behavior on a sub-distribution; the contrasting
  framing asks instead whether a single weight can be understood globally [S2].
- Attribution graphs are computed on a replacement model that "incompletely and imperfectly
  captures the original", so they yield hypotheses, not conclusions [S11].
- Interchange-intervention accuracy is a fit statistic, meaningful only relative to a declared map
  class [S5].
- Monitorability ≠ faithfulness: a trace can be faithful and still omit factors a monitor needs [S12].

## Reference documentation

- **[volatile.md](volatile.md)** — dated frontier numbers, lane-occupancy flags, and per-source
  review status. Re-check this FIRST before any novelty verdict or write-up.

## Candidate lane  ⚠️ (expert to resolve — NOT verified)

- ⚠️ **The crowded list is still not exhaustive.** Every lane flagged here has now been
  saturation-checked and ALL came back occupied (all are listed above). No flagged lane remains open.
  **Treat any lane this map does not mention as unchecked, not open, and search before committing —
  the measured base rate for unchecked lanes in this forge is 11/11 occupied.**
- ⚠️ **The actionability negative result [S3] is one clinical domain, one model family.** It is the
  strongest published statement of the knowledge-action gap, but generalization beyond triage
  vignettes is unverified. Confirm/refute: a replication in a non-clinical task with the same
  four-method comparison.
- ⚠️ **No peer-reviewed field-wide SURVEY was fetched** (a 2026 ACM Computing Surveys entry exists
  but was access-gated), and nothing independently confirms other labs made the same call as [S6].
  Individual claims are well-anchored — seven sources here are peer-reviewed — but a field-wide
  "the field holds X" statement still lacks a survey to rest on.

### [11] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-24 08:03:40 UTC

```
i want a reproducible bilingual study of refusal suppression in google/gemma-3-12b-it and cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct, with room for a genuine scientific discovery. compare each original model with one Heretic-abliterated version, evaluating all four checkpoints in English and Slovene. establish the safety–utility trade-offs, then investigate what explains them internally.

the attached research plan defines the intended study and supplies literature leads. verify its factual claims and references. this prompt governs execution: keep the core comparison fixed, but choose the mechanistic methods and discovery direction yourself. do not assume the expected findings are true.

Gemma-IT is a same-family, same-size aligned reference, not the direct training parent of GaMS-Instruct. endpoint differences cannot establish what Slovene continual pretraining, instruction tuning, or the small safety-training set caused.

step 1 - explore and establish feasibility. load both original models, pin revisions, verify their official tokenizers and chat templates, and inspect behavior and activations on a small development set in both languages. check coherent output, baseline refusal, and hidden-state extraction. use text-only inputs and comparable precision and inference settings; record unavoidable differences. inspect where the models behave similarly and where they differ, without committing to a mechanism. estimate the compute needed before scaling up. use separate smoke-test data and keep final evaluation untouched. if an edit fails or destroys language ability, investigate and report the failure rather than quietly substituting another model or calling incoherence successful refusal suppression.

step 2 - find the scientific opening. develop 5–7 distinct, falsifiable explanations or research directions from the pilot and the literature. search beyond refusal-vector papers, including multilingual representations, decision calibration, causal intervention, and capability interference. actively try to disprove novelty by reading the closest primary sources. select one or two promising directions for deeper experiments.

possible starting points: does cross-language intervention transfer depend on something that direction cosine misses? can we distinguish loss of harmfulness information from a changed mapping between that information and refusal? does interference with language-relevant computation explain different utility costs? these are suggestions, not required findings or an exhaustive menu. replace them if the evidence points somewhere better.

for each selected hypothesis, state its prediction, strongest competing explanation, simplest baseline, and a result that would falsify it. discovering that familiar geometry fails to predict behavior can be valuable if you establish its boundary. merely applying Heretic to GaMS, observing EN–SL vector similarity, or finding separable harmfulness after refusal declines is insufficient by itself as a novelty claim. if an exploratory hypothesis fails the novelty check, replace that hypothesis while preserving the core study.

step 3 - freeze the data and intervention protocol. separate Heretic construction/optimization data, mechanistic development data, held-out mechanistic validation, and final behavioral evaluation. keep translations, paraphrases, and harmful/harmless counterparts from the same semantic source together when splitting. audit overlap by source and meaning, not only exact strings. Heretic's default sources and Semantic-Harmful/Semantic-Harmless may overlap; those pairs cannot automatically serve as independent validation.

create one main Heretic checkpoint per original model using the same pinned version, English prompt source, comparable objectives, and equal search budgets. choose checkpoints by a declared development-only rule balancing refusal reduction and harmless divergence. evaluate that same English-derived edit in both languages. a community Gemma edit is a sanity reference, not a substitute for the matched main intervention. record configurations, seeds, selected trials, precision, and checkpoint hashes. distinguish differences in achieved optimization from intrinsic model properties. additional seeds or edit strengths may support a focused robustness analysis, but keep them separate from the four core checkpoints.

step 4 - measure behavior and utility. use the official NASK-PIB/RefusEU evaluation data for English and Slovene, following its published scoring protocol where reproducible. report harmful compliance/attack success, refusal, and language consistency separately. refusal and harmful compliance are not complements: ambiguous, irrelevant, malformed, and empty outputs need explicit treatment. include a small independent benign safety-adjacent set to measure over-refusal. a model that refuses everything, or cannot answer coherently, must not look successful.

use the same frozen judge and rubric across conditions, with model identity hidden. check scoring sensitivity using a second independent judge on a stratified sample. prepare a blinded EN/SL sample for human review; if qualified human review is unavailable, mark it pending and state the limitation instead of claiming it happened.

for utility, use Slovenian LLM Eval and the corresponding English tasks: ARC-Challenge, BoolQ, HellaSwag, OpenBookQA, PIQA, and Winogrande. report individual tasks and their macro-average, emphasizing original-to-edited changes within each language. also measure harmless divergence on held-out inputs, wrong-language output, repetition, and output validity. Heretic's optimization KL alone is not independent evidence of preserved utility.

do not assume RefusEU examples sharing an ID are exact translations, or that EN and SL benchmark difficulty is identical. verify correspondence before making paired cross-language claims. use a separate faithful EN/SL contrast set for controlled language comparisons. translate only missing material, preserve semantic IDs, document translation checks, and distinguish automated checks from native-speaker review. published model-card scores are context and sanity checks; measure the four checkpoints yourself under the same protocol.

step 5 - connect representations to behavior. complete the mechanistic core: layer-wise bilingual harmful/harmless direction characterization in both originals, and held-out harmfulness separability before and after Heretic. choose and justify activation locations and token positions. select layers, probes, and hyperparameters on development data only.

control for topic, wording, prompt length, language identity, and response leakage. decoding harmfulness from generated refusal text is not evidence that a pre-response harmfulness signal drives refusal. compare a frozen original-model probe with appropriately cross-validated probes refitted after editing where useful: failure of the frozen probe can reflect representation drift rather than information loss. do not interpret raw cross-model vector cosine as shared mechanism without establishing comparable coordinates.

relate internal measurements to actual behavioral changes in each language. high probe accuracy establishes decodability, not causal use. a harmful-minus-harmless direction is only refusal-associated until interventions support a stronger interpretation. changes in a direction directly targeted by Heretic are expected and cannot alone carry the discovery.

step 6 - pursue the strongest explanation. use the freedom from step 2 to design the smallest decisive experiment. where justified, extract EN- and SL-derived directions and test the source-language × evaluation-language transfer matrix within each model. choose intervention locations and strengths on development data, and include no-op and matched random-direction controls plus benign utility checks. keep these activation interventions separate from the main Heretic comparison.

you may instead pursue subspaces, layer-specific interventions, representation-to-action coupling, or another approach supported by the pilot. the goal is a result that distinguishes competing explanations and predicts something on untouched data. use held-out semantic categories or an independent prompt source to challenge it. explain what survives, what breaks, and where the claim stops. prefer one well-tested insight over a large collection of loosely connected metrics. preserve the behavioral and mechanistic core even if every novelty candidate fails.

step 7 - test the claims honestly. freeze primary outcomes and confirmatory analyses before final evaluation. report original-to-edited effects for each model and language, with effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals. compare those changes across models and languages without attributing them to a specific training stage.

state the resampling and aggregation units. pair outputs on the same prompts and cluster translations/paraphrases by underlying semantic item; use cross-language pairing only where correspondence is established. four checkpoints, many layers, or many prompts do not create many independent model families. prompt-level uncertainty also does not measure variation across Heretic optimization runs. account for searching across hypotheses and layers, separate exploratory from confirmatory results, and state when sample sizes cannot resolve a difference. if resources require subsampling, freeze a stratified sample before viewing results and narrow the claims accordingly.

bonus - examine cjvt/GaMS3-12B as a bounded pre-instruction diagnostic. test harmfulness separability and a small EN/SL behavior sample with appropriate base-model formatting. do not compare its raw refusal rate with chat models as if the tasks were identical. only attempt base abliteration if refusal-like behavior is reproducible, the intervention has an interpretable target, and it does not jeopardize the main study. intermediate training checkpoints and no-safety training controls belong to a later extension unless already available.

deliver a reproducible repository and a paper grounded in executed experiments: pinned dependencies, split manifests, configurations, per-example outputs and scores, analysis scripts, and figures covering the four checkpoints in both languages. distinguish observations, interpretations, failed hypotheses, and unexecuted proposals. recompute every headline number from saved results and reconcile the abstract, tables, figures, and conclusions after the final audit. the discovery may change as evidence accumulates; the final paper must reflect the strongest claim that actually survives.

   `keep:` takes a one-line reason. `delete:` takes `redownloadable` or
