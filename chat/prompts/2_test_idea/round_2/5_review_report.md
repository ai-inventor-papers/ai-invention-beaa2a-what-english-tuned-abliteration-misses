<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: An adversarial paper reviewer (Step 3.5: REVIEW_REPORT in the invention loop)

You received a paper draft written by a DIFFERENT model. Review it with fresh eyes.
Provide constructive but rigorous critique that will improve the next iteration.

Specific critiques → better paper. Vague praise → no improvement.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

ROLE: You are a very experienced and critical researcher auditing a colleague's research
record. Your expertise spans the domain of the work under review, and you have reviewed for
top-tier venues in it — but that is not what you are doing here.

WHAT YOU ARE REVIEWING: the run's INTERNAL RESEARCH REPORT, not a paper. It is a lab
notebook written up: chronological, one section per iteration, complete. Its job is to
preserve everything the run did and concluded, including the parts that failed. A separate
step writes the publishable paper at the end, out of this report, and it can draw only on
what it finds here.

TASK: Audit the record. Is every result that exists written down, in full? Can each number
be traced to the artifact that produced it? Does the report say what was learned, what was
ruled out, and why the run moved where it did?

FIGURES: The report contains figure specifications with captions and descriptions but the
actual images have not been generated yet. Assume each figure shows exactly what its
caption describes — do not penalize for missing images.

ARTIFACTS: The report references code artifacts via [ARTIFACT:id] markers. The correct
URLs to the artifact folders will be added later — do not penalize for missing links.

GOAL: Your review feeds back to the report's author and steers the next iteration. Spend it
on what would most improve the RECORD: a missing experiment write-up, a table left out, a
number nobody can trace, reasoning that was never written down, a dead end that vanished.
Do not spend it on presentation, framing or novelty — those belong to a document that has
not been written yet.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES: Provide a thorough assessment touching on each of these:
(a) Completeness: Is every experiment the run executed written up, with its tables in
    full? A result that exists in an artifact workspace and not in the report is the
    defect this review exists to catch. Are dead ends recorded as dead ends rather than
    quietly dropped?
(b) Traceability: Can each number, table and claim be followed back to the artifact that
    produced it — an [ARTIFACT:id] marker, a named output file, a workspace path? Could a
    reader re-run what is described and get the same thing?
(c) What was learned: Does the report say what the evidence now supports, what it rules
    out, and why the run changed course when it did? Is the reasoning behind each
    iteration recorded, or only its outcome?
(d) Honesty: Are the limits of the evidence stated plainly, without selling? Does any claim
    outrun what actually ran?

SUPPLEMENTARY SCORES: Rate each on a 1-4 scale.
Soundness (1-4) — soundness of the technical claims and of the experimental methodology as the
report describes it, and whether every claim is supported by evidence that ran:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor
Presentation (1-4) — quality of writing, clarity, and contextualization relative to prior work:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor
Contribution (1-4) — how much of the run this report actually preserves: every experiment and table
recorded, every step's reasoning captured, every dead end kept with its evidence:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor

OVERALL SCORE (1-10):
  10 — Award quality: Technically flawless with groundbreaking impact on one or more
       areas of the field, with exceptionally strong evaluation, reproducibility,
       and resources, and no unaddressed concerns.
   9 — Very Strong Accept: Technically flawless with groundbreaking impact on at least
       one area and excellent impact on multiple areas, with flawless evaluation,
       resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   8 — Strong Accept: Technically strong with novel ideas, excellent impact on at least
       one area or high-to-excellent impact on multiple areas, with excellent evaluation,
       resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   7 — Accept: Technically solid, with high impact on at least one sub-area or
       moderate-to-high impact on more than one area, with good-to-excellent evaluation,
       resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   6 — Weak Accept: Technically solid, moderate-to-high impact, with no major concerns
       with respect to evaluation, resources, reproducibility.
   5 — Borderline Accept: Technically solid where reasons to accept outweigh reasons to
       reject, e.g., limited evaluation. Use sparingly.
   4 — Borderline Reject: Technically solid where reasons to reject, e.g., limited
       evaluation, outweigh reasons to accept. Use sparingly.
   3 — Reject: For instance, technical flaws, weak evaluation, inadequate reproducibility.
   2 — Strong Reject: For instance, major technical flaws, poor evaluation, limited
       impact, poor reproducibility.
   1 — Very Strong Reject: For instance, trivial results or unaddressed concerns.

CONFIDENCE (1-5):
  5: Absolutely certain. Very familiar with related work, checked details carefully.
  4: Confident but not absolutely certain. Unlikely you misunderstood something.
  3: Fairly confident. Possible you missed some related work or details.
  2: Willing to defend your assessment, but quite likely missed central aspects.
  1: Educated guess. Not in your area or difficult to evaluate.

For each dimension, provide a list of specific improvements:
- WHAT needs to change
- HOW to change it (concrete enough for the author to act on immediately)
- EXPECTED SCORE IMPACT: how much would fixing this raise the overall score?

REVIEW PRINCIPLES:
- Be specific and actionable — vague critique is useless
- Ground your review in evidence — search for existing work, accepted papers, known results
- Rank critiques by score impact — address the biggest score blockers first
- Distinguish major issues (the record is incomplete or untraceable) from minor issues (polish)
- Acknowledge genuine strengths — don't be negative for its own sake
- Compare against the bar set by accepted papers at top-tier venues
- Check COMPLETENESS artifact by artifact. Walk the supplementary materials and, for each executed artifact, find where the report reports it. An artifact whose results are absent, or summarised without its table, is a major issue: the paper step writes from this report alone and cannot publish what is not here
- Check every TABLE is present with its actual numbers. Open the output files and compare. Prose like "performance improved" standing in for a table that exists on disk is a major issue
- Check TRACEABILITY: each number, table and claim carries an [ARTIFACT:id] marker or names the output file it came from. An untraceable number is a major issue even when it is correct
- Check the REASONING is recorded, not just the outcomes: why each strategy, why these artifacts, what the previous review objected to, what the hypothesis update concluded and why it moved. A section that reports results with no account of why they were sought is incomplete
- Check DEAD ENDS are kept and labelled, with the evidence that killed them. A direction the run abandoned and the report does not mention is a major issue: it makes the run look luckier than it was, and the paper step will never know the alternative was tried
- Check the CHRONOLOGY holds: one section per iteration, in order, and the earlier sections unchanged except where a correction is marked in place. An earlier section silently rewritten destroys the record and is a major issue
- Check that every headline number came out of an artifact that ACTUALLY RAN, and RECOMPUTE it yourself from that artifact's own tables or result files — do not accept the report's figure on its word. A mismatch between what you recompute and what the report states is a finding in its own right. Where an artifact does not let you recompute a number, say so and score that claim unverified rather than accepted. A projected, expected, illustrative or placeholder number presented as a result is the most serious defect this report can have — set results_reported false and blocking true
- When the report claims a POSITIVE, non-obvious result, name the nearest published result that already answers something close to it and state what this iteration adds beyond that neighbour. This checks whether the FINDING has earned its claim, not how the paper will be framed against the literature: a positive result gets no credit for novelty in this record until that comparison is made, and its absence is a critique under 'novelty'
- Check for an iteration that added METRICS rather than SAMPLES to an already underpowered panel. When a power analysis or the effect sizes on record show the artifact panel cannot detect the effect being chased, more candidate metrics or readouts over the same panel do not fix that — flag it as a major issue and say the budget belonged on more graded samples or checkpoints instead
- Check COVERAGE against the user's ORIGINAL request, not against the report's own framing. Name the part of the request the run has not addressed yet
- Check that claims are PROPORTIONATE to the evidence. A small, expected-direction effect written up as the answer is the failure mode to name explicitly
- Do NOT review this as a paper. Section order, narrative arc, abstract framing, figure count and writing polish are the later paper step's concerns, and a critique about them spends the run's iteration budget on the wrong document. The nearest-neighbour check above is different: it asks whether the record has earned its positive claim, not how the paper will be sold against the literature. Bookkeeping — run ids, timestamps, spend, review scores, file hashes — BELONGS in this report; never ask for its removal

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Fapgmt6JWbcD/3_invention_loop/iter_2/review_report/review_report`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Fapgmt6JWbcD/3_invention_loop/iter_2/review_report/review_report/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Fapgmt6JWbcD/3_invention_loop/iter_2/review_report/review_report/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Fapgmt6JWbcD/3_invention_loop/iter_2/review_report/review_report/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision.
   The `.aii/` directory ALREADY EXISTS in your cwd: write the file into
   it. Do not create, replace or `touch` `.aii` itself — a plain file by
   that name makes the manifest unwritable for the rest of the module.

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.

WHAT A `keep` BUYS YOU. Anything you do not mark `delete` stays exactly where
you wrote it, on this run's storage volume, at the path it already has — it is
not moved, renamed or copied. A later round reads it there, by that absolute
workspace path, so a checkpoint you keep is a checkpoint the next round can
load instead of retraining. It is also the ONLY copy: the publish step pushes
your cwd to GitHub but skips every file of 100 MB or
more, so trained weights and large binary artifacts never leave the volume.
Write the workspace path of each kept artifact into your results and your
`README.md`, so the paper can cite it by path rather than by a link that
was never pushed.

# What English-tuned abliteration misses in Slovene

## Framing

Abliteration removes refusal behaviour from language models by orthogonalising weight matrices against a "refusal direction" extracted from English harmful-vs-harmless contrasts [1]. The procedure was introduced by Arditi et al. [1] and automated by tools such as Heretic, which uses TPE search over layer, position, direction index, and LoRA rank to find abliteration configurations that minimise an English refusal objective while bounding KL divergence from the original model. The question motivating this study is whether that English-centred objective leaves Slovene refusal behaviour uncontrolled. If the English refusal direction is universal across languages, as Wang et al. [2] report for safety-aligned models evaluated across 14 languages, then abliteration tuned on English should transfer to Slovene. If instead Slovene refusal relies partly on representations that the English objective does not observe, a gap will remain. The practical consequence is that a model abliterated to comply in English might still refuse in Slovene, or might lose Slovene capabilities that the English-only KL constraint does not protect.

Several concurrent lines of work inform this question. BabelSteering [4] and Yoon et al. [5] show that safety alignment imposes disparate costs across languages, with non-English users bearing higher utility loss. Aziz et al. [6] diagnose the breakdown point for low-resource safety as an action failure rather than a representation failure: the model encodes harmfulness correctly but fails to convert the representation into refusal. Wu et al. [7] formalise this as a disentangled safety hypothesis, separating a recognition axis from an execution axis. On the abliteration side, Fafula [8] documents off-target effects of refusal removal across model families, and Young [14] and Petrov [15] compare abliteration methods across architectures. Upadhyaya and Sikdar [9] analyse how safety and language identity become entangled, while Hawkins et al. [10] show that benign multilingual fine-tuning has heterogeneous safety impacts. Labunets [11] demonstrates that refusal geometry reflects refusal training diversity. On quantisation effects relevant to our NF4 setup, Marchisio et al. [12] and Chimoto et al. [13] show that quantisation calibration language matters for multilingual performance. Tang et al. [16] identify language-specific neurons, and Ghussin et al. [17] propose principled layer selection for multilingual steering. Frank [18] argues that refusal-based alignment evaluation conflates detection with routing.

We study this question in a controlled bilingual setting using two sibling 12B models from the Gemma-3 family: google/gemma-3-12b-it (the English-centric reference) and cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct (a Slovene continual-pretraining and SFT variant of the same architecture). Both are loaded in bnb_4bit NF4 quantisation throughout. The study proceeds in two iterations. Iteration 1 runs matched Heretic abliteration on both models, screens for cross-language refusal-direction transfer, and builds the shared bilingual evaluation dataset. Iteration 2 uses that dataset to measure the surrogacy gap (what English outcomes fail to predict about Slovene), test causal mechanisms, and evaluate safety and utility on held-out benchmarks.

## Iteration 1

### Experiment 1: Matched Heretic runs [ARTIFACT:art_vzhOPupFwE4M]

**Goal.** Run identical Heretic TPE searches on both models under the same seed, select an abliterated checkpoint for each, and compare the two models' responses to the same edits.

**Setup.** Both models were searched over 116 complete trials (seed 20260923) using Heretic (SHA 3521f864) with the default configuration: orthogonalize_direction=true, row_normalization='full', rank-3 LoRA. The English keyword refusal rate (out of 100 harmful prompts) and mean KL divergence served as Heretic's two objectives. Selection followed a frozen protocol: minimise KL subject to refusals ≤ 10; if no trial met this primary criterion, fall back to minimising refusals subject to KL ≤ 1.0. Both models fell back to the secondary rule.

**Selected trials.** GaMS3 trial 88 reached 16/100 English refusals at KL 0.175. Gemma trial 96 reached 69/100 English refusals at KL 0.024. The Gemma model refused far more often than GaMS3 under identical abliteration parameters, and no Gemma trial achieved ≤ 50/100 refusals. The ratio of median refusal counts (Gemma / GaMS3) across the 60 shared startup edits was 13.4× [6.9, 30.4]. In all 60 startup edits, Gemma refused at least as often as GaMS3 (60/60, median paired difference +25).

**Behaviour on the selected trials.** The table below shows keyword refusal rates (out of 100 harmful prompts) and FLORES+ NLL for each checkpoint.

| Model | Checkpoint | EN refusals | SL refusals | KL mean | FLORES NLL EN | FLORES NLL SL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | original | 98 | 97 | 0.000 | 3.332 | 2.570 |
| GaMS3 | own edit (trial 88) | 16 | 10 | 0.175 | 3.334 | 2.566 |
| GaMS3 | swap (Gemma trial 96) | 25 | 25 | 0.046 | 3.336 | 2.576 |
| Gemma | original | 100 | 100 | 0.000 | 3.930 | 3.427 |
| Gemma | own edit (trial 96) | 69 | 85 | 0.024 | 3.929 | 3.432 |
| Gemma | swap (GaMS3 trial 88) | 91 | 95 | 0.293 | 3.944 | 3.455 |

GaMS3's own edit reduced English refusals from 98 to 16 and Slovene refusals from 97 to 10. Slovene refusal dropped even though Heretic optimised only on English, and FLORES NLL changed by at most 0.01. For Gemma, the edit reduced English refusals from 100 to 69 but Slovene refusals only from 100 to 85. Swapping edits between models did not reproduce the other model's behaviour: GaMS3 under Gemma's edit showed 25/25 (EN/SL) refusals, and Gemma under GaMS3's edit showed 91/95, both far from the original model's own-edit performance.

**Direction geometry.** Across layers 24--47, the mean cosine between the two models' diff-in-means refusal directions was 0.57; across all layers it was 0.63. The cosine between their harmless-token directions was 0.98. Random directions gave a mean |cos| of 0.014. The refusal directions are more aligned than chance but far from parallel; the harmless directions are near-identical, consistent with the shared tokenizer and architecture.

**A3 screen (paired startup edits).** The Spearman correlation of refusal counts between the two models across 60 paired edits was 0.78 [0.63, 0.88]. KL divergence correlated at 0.97. However, the incremental variance explained by the sibling model's outcome (dR2_sibling) was near zero for both directions of prediction, meaning the two models' refusal counts are correlated through shared parameters but one model's outcome does not add predictive value over those parameters. The screen verdict was "shared via strength only": the correlation is driven by parameter strength, not by a direct refusal-mechanism coupling.

**Sanity checks.** All 60 startup edits used identical parameter draws (verified). FLORES NLL shifts were ≤ 0.01 for both models. Slovene marker validation on the selected GaMS3 edit showed accuracy 0.75 and kappa 0.48 (fair agreement between keyword markers and LLM-judge labels).

### Dataset construction [ARTIFACT:art_qdUCJWbc5kHh]

**Goal.** Build a frozen bilingual (EN/SL) evaluation dataset that spans safety, utility, and mechanistic probing, using matched translation quality controls.

**Result.** The dataset contains 48,696 rows across 10 blocks (S1--S7 families): S1 (Heretic direction/KL calibration, 2000 rows), S2 (semantic harmful/harmless pairs, 1664), S3 screen prompts (540 prompts + 640 utility items), S4 (StrongReject harmful/harmless twins, 1028), S5 (RefusEU [3], 2800), S5X (RefusEU cross-translations, 1400), S6 (XSTest over-refusal, 900), S7 (Slovenian LLM eval tasks including ARC, BoolQ, HellaSwag, 35,700; FLORES+ devtest, 2024). Protocol hash: dc33bde4.

**Translation.** Slovene translations were produced by Gemini-2.5-flash (temperature 0) as the primary translator, with NLLB-200-distilled-1.3B as fallback for 8 rows where Gemini refused. Mean back-translation chrF was 81.25; 3 rows fell below chrF 40. Mean LaBSE cross-lingual similarity was 0.856. Quality control was automated only (back-translation chrF, LaBSE, GlotLID); no native-speaker review was conducted.

**Splits.** Items are assigned to halves A and B by SHA-1 hash of their semantic ID. This split is used throughout iteration 2 for placebo-controlled surrogacy analyses: English traits computed on half A predict English (placebo) and Slovene (test) on half B.

---

### Experiment 3: A1 screen, EN vs. SL refusal-direction transfer [ARTIFACT:art_jxrJNc9o4QSp]

**Goal.** Screen whether the English-extracted refusal direction transfers to Slovene, using a 2×2 matrix (source language × evaluation language), increment tests, and multiple controls. This was a screen, not a confirmatory test.

**Setup.** For each model, the experiment extracted refusal directions from half-A items using diff-in-means on harmful vs. harmless activations, separately for English and Slovene. It then applied 15 ablation conditions per model (activation steering at inference) to half-B items and measured refusal rates using keyword markers and an LLM judge. The judge was gpt-4.1 for 1,596 outputs (recovered from logs after an API budget exhaustion) and Qwen3-14B locally for the remainder.

**Precision deviations.** Several deviations from the original plan were recorded. The Gemma candidate grid was cut to every-second layer and positions {-1, -5} for GPU time constraints. Translation used a system/user wrapper prompt because bare Gemini prompts elicited refusal. NLLB served as fallback for 22/1070 translation rows. Winsorization (q = 0.995) was applied to directions because one massive-activation dimension dominated the raw diff-in-means.

**Validity gates.** The R validity gate (refusal readout Spearman correlation with judged refusal across 16 conditions) passed for Gemma (Spearman 0.91, AUROC 0.96) but failed for GaMS3 (Spearman 0.51, AUROC 0.70). The GaMS3 failure means the keyword-based refusal readout did not track actual refusal behaviour well enough for the screen's quantitative tests to be trusted. Per the frozen protocol (rule F6), the screen's primary outcome falls to the judged refusal rate for GaMS3.

**GaMS3 results.** Because the R validity gate failed, quantitative screen results for GaMS3 are exploratory. The baseline English refusal score was 5.1 (arbitrary units); Slovene was 2.0. The 15 ablation conditions showed varied effects, but no reliable conclusion about EN → SL transfer could be drawn from the GaMS3 data.

**Gemma results.** The Gemma validity gate passed. The key result: applying the English refusal direction (d_EN) at inference removed most English refusal (from 99% to low values depending on the condition), but Slovene refusal survived at 0.85 residual on a matched-efficacy comparison. The predicted EN → SL transfer was reversed: the screen expected the English direction to reduce Slovene refusal proportionally, but instead SL refusal persisted.

**Screen verdict.** WEAK. The predicted cross-language transfer contrast was reversed for Gemma. For GaMS3, the validity gate failure prevented a quantitative verdict. The screen provided the initial signal that English abliteration may miss Slovene refusal, motivating the confirmatory analyses in iteration 2.

**Matched-efficacy grid.** Conditions rescaled so that English refusal dropped by equal amounts showed that Slovene refusal systematically persisted more than English refusal at every matched English decrement. The transfer matrix (source × evaluation language) confirmed that English directions removed English refusal but left substantial Slovene refusal intact.

**Addition dose-response.** Increasing the steering coefficient (scaling up the English refusal direction) reduced both English and Slovene refusal, but Slovene always lagged behind English: at every dose level, Slovene retained more refusal than English.

---

## Iteration 2

Iteration 2 built on the screen results from iteration 1 by running five pre-registered experiments that measured the surrogacy gap, tested causal mechanisms, and evaluated safety and utility on held-out data.

### Experiment 5: Utility and mechanism [ARTIFACT:art_a4VkEvYRquBO]

**Goal.** Evaluate whether the selected abliteration edits preserve utility across both languages and characterise the internal geometry of the harm representation before and after editing.

#### T1: Harmful behaviour (S4 harmful items, 257 per cell)

The table below shows judged refusal rates on held-out harmful items (S4, 257 items per model × checkpoint × language). The gpt-4.1 judge labelled a random ~52% subsample; remaining items used a second-family free judge (Nemotron-3-ultra-550b); markers show the Heretic keyword rule on all 257.

| Model | Ckpt | Lang | Refused % [95% CI] | Complied % [95% CI] |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | orig | EN | 100.0 [100.0, 100.0] | 0.0 [0.0, 0.0] |
| GaMS3 | orig | SL | 100.0 [100.0, 100.0] | 0.0 [0.0, 0.0] |
| GaMS3 | edit | EN | 5.6 [2.4, 9.5] | 92.9 [88.1, 96.8] |
| GaMS3 | edit | SL | 6.7 [3.0, 11.1] | 89.6 [84.4, 94.1] |
| Gemma | orig | EN | 99.3 [97.8, 100.0] | 0.7 [0.0, 2.2] |
| Gemma | orig | SL | 99.2 [97.6, 100.0] | 0.8 [0.0, 2.4] |
| Gemma | edit | EN | 70.3 [61.9, 78.0] | 24.6 [16.9, 32.2] |
| Gemma | edit | SL | 95.3 [92.0, 98.7] | 4.0 [1.3, 7.3] |

For GaMS3, the edit reduced refusal from 100% to ~6% in both languages, with no meaningful EN-SL gap. For Gemma, the edit reduced English refusal from 99% to 70% but left Slovene refusal at 95%. This 25-percentage-point gap (70.3% vs. 95.3%) confirms the pattern seen in the iteration-1 screen: the English-tuned Heretic edit substantially missed Slovene refusal in Gemma.

Judge agreement: second judge vs. gpt-4.1 on a stratified sample of 200 gave 6-way kappa 0.765, refused-vs-not kappa 0.828, raw agreement 0.885.

#### T2: KL divergence on harmless twins (S4, 128-token generations)

| Model | Ckpt | Lang | KL1 median [95% CI] | KL32 median [95% CI] | Benign refusal % | Malformed % | Empty % |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | orig | EN | 0 (ref) | 0 (ref) | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| GaMS3 | orig | SL | 0 (ref) | 0 (ref) | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| GaMS3 | edit | EN | 0.0441 [0.0323, 0.0530] | 0.0228 [0.0196, 0.0250] | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| GaMS3 | edit | SL | 0.0174 [0.0152, 0.0211] | 0.0068 [0.0061, 0.0086] | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Gemma | orig | EN | 0 (ref) | 0 (ref) | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Gemma | orig | SL | 0 (ref) | 0 (ref) | 9.5 | 0.4 | 0.0 |
| Gemma | edit | EN | 0.0000 [0.0000, 0.0000] | 0.0150 [0.0125, 0.0171] | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Gemma | edit | SL | 0.0113 [0.0083, 0.0163] | 0.0037 [0.0030, 0.0046] | 0.0 | 0.4 | 0.0 |

KL1 values ranged from 0.011 to 0.044. Gemma EN edit showed KL1 median 0.0000 (at the first token the edit barely changed harmless outputs). Output validity was clean across all cells.

#### T3: Utility (0-shot, 250 items per task per language)

| Model | Lang | Macro original | Macro edited | Change [95% CI] | Holm p |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | EN | 72.5 | 72.7 | +0.13 [-0.53, +0.80] | 1.000 |
| GaMS3 | SL | 64.9 | 65.1 | +0.20 [-0.73, +1.13] | 1.000 |
| Gemma | EN | 71.5 | 71.6 | +0.13 [-0.53, +0.80] | 1.000 |
| Gemma | SL | 62.1 | 62.1 | +0.00 [-0.60, +0.60] | 1.000 |

All macro changes were ≤ 0.20 points. All Holm-corrected p-values were 1.000 over the 4 macro comparisons. Individual task changes ranged from -1.20 to +1.60 points; none reached significance. The edits did not measurably alter utility in either language for either model.

#### T4: FLORES+ per-token NLL

| Model | Lang | NLL original | NLL edited | Change [95% CI] |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | EN | 3.3072 | 3.3068 | -0.0004 [-0.0025, +0.0016] |
| GaMS3 | SL | 2.4524 | 2.4526 | +0.0002 [-0.0012, +0.0016] |
| Gemma | EN | 3.9194 | 3.9174 | -0.0020 [-0.0031, -0.0008] |
| Gemma | SL | 3.4289 | 3.4293 | +0.0004 [-0.0007, +0.0016] |

NLL shifts were ≤ 0.002 for all cells. The Gemma English NLL decrease (-0.002) was statistically below zero but negligible in magnitude.

#### T5: Bilingual harm geometry (original models, primary site)

| Model | Layer | cos(d_EN, d_SL) | Corrected | CV AUROC DiM EN/SL | S4 frozen DiM EN/SL | cos(lang dir, d_EN) | Shuffled AUROC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | 34 | 0.832 | 0.890 | 0.963 / 0.945 | 0.998 / 0.997 | 0.035 | 0.490 |
| Gemma | 20 | 0.919 | 0.979 | 0.979 / 0.941 | 0.997 / 0.996 | 0.109 | 0.515 |

Cross-validation AUROC on S3 development items exceeded 0.94 for both models in both languages. Cross-language transfer on held-out S4 items exceeded 0.995 in both directions for both models. The harm direction is shared across languages. The language-identity direction is near-orthogonal to d_EN (cos 0.035 and 0.109). Shuffled-label AUROC was at chance (0.49--0.52), confirming the directions are not artifacts of data leakage.

Both models encode harmfulness similarly across EN and SL in their representations. The harm direction is shared; the language direction is separate. For Gemma, the behavioural gap (70.3% vs. 95.3% residual refusal) cannot be attributed to a representational difference: the model knows the prompt is harmful in both languages, but acts on that knowledge differently.

#### T6: Frozen vs. refit probes (S4, primary site)

| Model | Lang | Probe | Frozen orig AUROC | Frozen edit-orig [95% CI] | Refit edit-orig [95% CI] | Class |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | EN | dim | 0.998 | -0.401 [-0.434, -0.368] | -0.014 [-0.021, -0.007] | INFO-LOSS |
| GaMS3 | EN | lr | 0.999 | -0.596 [-0.623, -0.570] | -0.000 [-0.001, 0.001] | DRIFT |
| GaMS3 | SL | dim | 0.997 | -0.576 [-0.611, -0.542] | -0.043 [-0.056, -0.030] | INFO-LOSS |
| GaMS3 | SL | lr | 0.996 | -0.661 [-0.691, -0.635] | -0.000 [-0.002, 0.002] | DRIFT |
| Gemma | EN | dim | 0.997 | -0.000 [-0.001, 0.000] | -0.000 [-0.001, 0.000] | PRESERVED |
| Gemma | EN | lr | 0.996 | -0.001 [-0.002, 0.000] | -0.000 [-0.000, 0.000] | PRESERVED |
| Gemma | SL | dim | 0.996 | -0.000 [-0.001, 0.000] | -0.000 [-0.001, 0.000] | PRESERVED |
| Gemma | SL | lr | 0.989 | -0.002 [-0.003, -0.001] | 0.000 [-0.000, 0.000] | DRIFT |

All-layer profile (minimum frozen-probe AUROC on edited activations):

| Model | Lang | Min frozen-edit AUROC (layer) | Refit AUROC there |
|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | EN | 0.201 (L27) | 0.993 |
| GaMS3 | SL | 0.196 (L27) | 0.987 |
| Gemma | EN | 0.507 (L4) | 0.709 |
| Gemma | SL | 0.492 (L6) | 0.740 |

For GaMS3, the frozen probe collapsed after editing: AUROC dropped to 0.201 at the worst layer, but a refit probe recovered to 0.993. The edit moved the harm signal away from its original subspace (INFO-LOSS on dim, DRIFT on logistic), but the information persisted in a different location.

For Gemma, the frozen probe was preserved: AUROC dropped by at most 0.002. The edit did not move the harm representation.

The contrast is informative. GaMS3's edit reached low refusal in both languages by destroying the harm signal at the probe layer. Gemma's edit left the harm signal intact, consistent with its failure to suppress Slovene refusal: the model still encodes harmfulness, but the readout mechanism was partially disrupted for English while the Slovene readout remained functional.

#### T7: Drift geometry

For GaMS3, Cohen's d on the frozen harm axis dropped from 6.20 to 0.30 (EN) and from 5.61 to -0.18 (SL). The share of mean-difference energy on the frozen axis dropped from 0.71 to 0.002 (EN). The cosine between the pre- and post-edit refit axes was 0.274 (EN) and 0.188 (SL), confirming the edit rotated the harm axis. Collapse onset was at layer 22.

For Gemma, Cohen's d dropped from 5.29 to 4.94 (EN) and from 3.76 to 3.50 (SL). The frozen axis retained most of its energy share (0.83 → 0.80). The cosine between refit axes was 0.981. The edit barely moved the harm signal.

#### T8: Readout validity gate (S4 judged items)

| Model | Lang | R_seq item AUROC | R_seq 16-cell Spearman | R_seq pass | R1 item AUROC | R1 pass | Primary trait |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | EN | 0.989 | 0.867 | True | 0.979 | False | R_seq |
| GaMS3 | SL | 0.995 | 0.899 | True | 0.963 | False | R_seq |
| Gemma | EN | 0.804 | 0.861 | False | 0.897 | False | JUDGE_ONLY |
| Gemma | SL | 0.920 | 0.856 | True | 0.968 | True | R_seq |

GaMS3 R_seq passed in both languages. Gemma R_seq passed only for SL; EN was classified as JUDGE_ONLY, meaning the judge labels should be trusted over the R_seq score for Gemma EN cells. R1 did not pass for GaMS3 in either language.

#### T9: Criterion shift vs. evidence loss

Both models showed EVIDENCE_LOSS under both R_seq and R1 readouts: the slope of the decision function decreased after editing, indicating the internal signal weakened rather than the threshold shifting. For GaMS3, the R_seq slope ratio was 0.36 (EN) and 0.42 (SL). For Gemma, the R_seq slope ratio was 0.61 (EN) and 0.48 (SL).

#### T10: r_prior geometry (original models)

The false-refusal direction r_prior (constructed from prompts judged harmless that the model refuses, orthogonalised to d_EN) was defined for both models. For GaMS3, 36 refusals (15 EN, 21 SL) out of 275 r_prior generations; cos(r_prior, d_EN) before orthogonalisation was 0.824 (pooled). For Gemma, 55 refusals (8 EN, 47 SL) out of 273; cos(r_prior, d_EN) was 0.631. The within-SL cos(r_prior, lang_dir) was -0.038 (GaMS3) and -0.139 (Gemma), confirming r_prior is not simply the language direction.

#### T12: Edit-strength dose-response (exploratory)

| Model | Scale f | Marker refusal EN % | Marker refusal SL % | KL1 median EN | KL1 median SL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | 0.0 | 95.8 | 100.0 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |
| GaMS3 | 0.5 | 75.0 | 68.8 | 0.0088 | 0.0037 |
| GaMS3 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0405 | 0.0177 |
| GaMS3 | 1.5 | 0.0 | 2.1 | 0.1610 | 0.1167 |
| Gemma | 0.0 | 93.8 | 100.0 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |
| Gemma | 0.5 | 60.4 | 95.8 | 0.0000 | 0.0046 |
| Gemma | 1.0 | 27.1 | 91.7 | 0.0000 | 0.0103 |
| Gemma | 1.5 | 22.9 | 68.8 | 0.0000 | 0.0303 |
| Gemma | 2.0 | 12.5 | 31.2 | 0.0000 | 0.0924 |
| Gemma | 3.0 | 4.2 | 8.3 | 0.0000 | 0.8228 |

For GaMS3, scaling the LoRA edit by f = 0.5 brought both languages to 68--75% refusal; at f = 1.0 both reached 0%. EN and SL refusal declined in parallel. For Gemma, at f = 1.0 (the core edit) EN refusal was 27% while SL was 92%. Reaching SL refusal below 10% required f = 3.0, at which point KL divergence rose to 0.82 (SL), well above Heretic's operational range. This dose-response confirms that the EN-SL gap in Gemma is not an artifact of edit strength: at every dose level, SL refusal exceeded EN refusal.

[FIGURE:fig_dose_response]

#### T13: GaMS3 base model diagnostic (pre-instruction, descriptive)

The uninstructed cjvt/GaMS3-12B base model (before SFT) was tested with a Question/Answer format at layer 34. Frozen S3→S4 diff-in-means AUROC was 0.817 (EN) and 0.773 (SL). Grouped-CV S4 AUROC reached 0.988 (EN) and 0.958 (SL). The cosine between the base model's EN and SL harm directions was 0.781; the cosine between the base model's d_EN and the instruction-tuned model's d_EN was 0.305. Out of 20 EN harmful continuations, 14 complied and 5 refused; out of 20 SL harmful continuations, 13 complied and 5 refused. The base model already encodes a harm axis that partially survives instruction tuning, but the low cosine with the instruct model's direction (0.305) indicates instruction tuning rotated the harm representation.

### Experiment 4: C1 behaviour, RefusEU evaluation [ARTIFACT:art_m6pglf516e2r]

**Goal.** Evaluate all checkpoints (originals, edits, community abliteration reference) on the held-out RefusEU multilingual refusal benchmark [3] in both EN and SL, measuring refusal rate, attack success rate, over-refusal, and response validity.

**Judge.** The primary judge was a local Qwen3-14B model (agreement with gpt-4.1: kappa 0.83 on 6-way labels, 0.91 on refused-vs-not; tested on a calibration set before deployment). The gpt-4.1 judge was blocked partway through by API budget limits, so local Qwen3-14B served as the sole judge for all 4,800 generations.

**Headline RefusEU (S5) refusal rates:**

| Model | Checkpoint | EN S5 refusal | SL S5 refusal | EN S6 over-refusal | SL S6 over-refusal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GaMS3 | original | 0.986 | 0.871 | 0.100 | 0.107 |
| GaMS3 | edit | 0.014 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| Gemma | original | 0.971 | 0.939 | 0.087 | 0.327 |
| Gemma | edit | 0.287 | 0.739 | 0.013 | 0.193 |
| Community ref | - | 0.054 | 0.114 | 0.007 | 0.027 |

All changes from original to edit were significant (Holm-corrected p < 1e-14 for refusal reductions). Invalid rate was 0.000 across all cells.

**GaMS3.** The edit reduced EN refusal from 0.986 to 0.014 and SL refusal from 0.871 to 0.000. Both languages reached near-zero refusal. Over-refusal dropped from ~0.10 to 0.000 in both languages. GaMS3's baseline SL refusal was already lower than its EN refusal (0.871 vs. 0.986), and the edit eliminated refusal in both languages.

**Gemma.** The edit reduced EN refusal from 0.971 to 0.287 and SL refusal from 0.939 to 0.739. The residual Slovene refusal (0.739) is 2.6× the residual English refusal (0.287). This is the headline result of the study: an English-tuned abliteration edit left most Slovene refusal intact in Gemma while removing most English refusal. Over-refusal dropped in both languages but remained substantial in SL (0.193 vs. 0.013 in EN for the edit). The original Gemma model already had high SL over-refusal (0.327), and the edit reduced it only to 0.193.

**Community reference abliteration.** A community Heretic abliteration applied to Gemma reached 0.054 EN refusal and 0.114 SL refusal. This more aggressive edit removed most refusal in both languages but had higher FLORES NLL shifts (0.054 EN, 0.111 SL) than the selected trial.

**Paired cross-language analysis (S5X, 100 matched pairs).** For Gemma edit, the paired EN-SL refusal gap was +0.69 [0.60, 0.78]: on the same semantic content, Slovene refusal exceeded English refusal by 69 percentage points. The difference-in-differences (edit gap minus original gap) was +0.66 [0.55, 0.76]. For the community reference, the gap was only +0.12 [0.05, 0.20].

### Experiment 6: GaMS3 surrogacy panel [ARTIFACT:art_KFZCxJcrr84K]

**Goal.** Measure the English surrogacy gap for GaMS3: for each abliteration trait, how much does an English outcome fail to predict the corresponding Slovene outcome?

**Method.** 246 Heretic edits (initial startup edits E0 plus TPE-selected edits E_TPE) were generated, activations collected on half-B items, and six traits measured: R (refusal, R_seq readout), R1 (R at first token), Rb (binary refusal), K (KL divergence), N (NLL), M (maximum logit). The primary learner was gradient-boosted trees. The surrogacy gap is defined as Gap_t = R2*(EN_A→EN_B) - R2*(EN_A→SL_B), where R2* is noise-ceiling normalised. The blind share B_t estimates the systematic (edit-determined) portion of the unseen Slovene variation. 160 non-collapsed edits were fitted.

**Gap table:**

| Trait | R2* placebo | R2* test | Gap | 95% CI | Holm p | B_t [95% CI] |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R | 0.983 | 0.968 | **0.015** | [0.006, 0.031] | NA | 0.004 [-0.004, 0.009] |
| R1 | 0.998 | 0.956 | **0.042** | [0.027, 0.070] | NA | 0.015 [0.002, 0.030] |
| Rb | 0.982 | 0.954 | **0.028** | [0.012, 0.068] | NA | 0.005 [-0.007, 0.013] |
| K | 0.977 | 0.830 | **0.147** | [0.074, 0.265] | 0.000 | 0.050 [0.001, 0.121] |
| N | -0.225 | 0.417 | -0.642 | [-14.8, 0.98] | 0.954 | - |
| M | 0.272 | 0.232 | 0.040 | [-8.37, 5.22] | 0.954 | - |

**Interpretation.** Gap_R = 0.015 [0.006, 0.031]: English refusal outcomes predicted Slovene refusal almost perfectly (R2* = 0.968), with only 1.5% of the ceiling left unexplained. This gap, while statistically above zero, is small. The blind share B_t for R was 0.004 with a CI spanning zero, meaning the small gap is mostly noise rather than a systematic edit-driven asymmetry. Verdict: CONFIRMATORY. Refusal is visible from English for GaMS3.

Gap_K = 0.147 [0.074, 0.265]: KL divergence showed a substantial surrogacy gap. English KL predicted Slovene KL at R2* = 0.830, leaving 14.7% of the ceiling unexplained. The blind share B_t = 0.050 [0.001, 0.121], with the CI excluding zero: part of this gap is systematically determined by the edit, not just noise. Verdict: BLIND. KL divergence has a component in Slovene that English KL does not see. Holm p = 0.000.

Gap_N and Gap_M showed no reliable signal (NLL and max-logit traits had low reliability in English, so the gap estimate was uninformative).

**Carrier regression.** The exposure differential D (log E_SL - log E_EN) was tested as a carrier of the surrogacy gap. For every trait, dR2(D given S0) was near zero or negative. The D carrier FAILED for all traits. The surrogacy gap is not explained by differences in how much the edit perturbs Slovene vs. English token representations on harmless text.

**Transfer slopes.** The SL/EN transfer slope for R was 0.82 [0.74, 0.90]: when the edit moves English refusal by one unit, Slovene refusal moves by 0.82 units. For K, the slope was 0.39 [0.34, 0.48], much stronger attenuation. For R1, the slope was 0.50 [0.46, 0.55].

**Forecast.** Conformal prediction intervals at 90% coverage met the 85% threshold on only 50% of trait × holdout-set combinations. The core edit (trial 88) was out of support for all traits, meaning it lay outside the distribution of TPE-explored edits. This limits the forecast's applicability to the specific selected checkpoint.

**Stability checks.** Gap estimates were stable across alternative learners, inclusion of collapsed edits, reverse-direction analysis (SL → EN), and MT-stable subsets.

---

### Experiment 7: Gemma surrogacy panel [ARTIFACT:art_CUChUm6wCwo5]

**Goal.** Measure the English surrogacy gap for Gemma using the same protocol as experiment 6.

**Setup.** 203 Heretic edits, 163 fitted. The same six traits were measured.

**Verdicts:**

- **P-a (Gap_R is small, ≤ 0.05):** NOT CONFIRMED. Gap_R1 = 0.054 [0.022, 0.128]. The gap exceeded the pre-registered threshold of 0.05 for R1.
- **P-b (Gap_Rb is small):** UNTESTABLE. The Rb validity gate failed, so the analysis was exploratory. Exploratory estimate: Gap_Rb = 0.018 [0.011, 0.043].
- **P-c (exposure differential carries the gap):** NOT CONFIRMED. dR2(P given base) and dR2(b1 given P) were near zero for both R1 and Rb.
- **P-d (matched-margin gap is small):** NOT CONFIRMED. Gap_margin_matched = 0.057 [0.029, 0.130].

**Key result.** Gap_K = +0.079 (Holm p = 0.009): KL divergence showed a surrogacy gap for Gemma as well, though smaller than GaMS3's 0.147. The SL/EN transfer slope for R1 was 0.436, indicating strong attenuation: when the edit moved English first-token refusal by one unit, Slovene moved only 0.44 units.

**Comparison with GaMS3.** The Gemma surrogacy gap on refusal traits was larger than GaMS3's (0.054 vs. 0.015 for R1), consistent with the behavioural result that Gemma retained more Slovene refusal after editing. The KL gap was smaller (0.079 vs. 0.147), but both models showed a significant blind component in KL.

---

### Experiment 8: Causal test [ARTIFACT:art_hmbXDppkPZnR]

**Goal.** Test whether the Slovene refusal that survived English abliteration can be causally removed by specific interventions, and identify where in the network the relevant information resides.

**Pre-registered hypothesis.** Subtracting the false-refusal direction r_prior (constructed from prompts judged harmless that the model refuses, following Wang et al. [2]) from the English refusal direction d_EN should cut the residual Slovene refusal by at least half, beyond what a random control achieves. The KILL criterion fires if the r_prior cut is not significantly larger than the best random control.

**Primary result: hypothesis FAILS.** Applying d_EN alone reduced Gemma's harmful EN refusal from 0.91 to 0.23 but left SL refusal at 0.86. Adding r_prior (arm A2: d_EN + r_prior) moved SL refusal to 0.83. The r_prior cut relative to d_EN alone was 0.036 [-0.037, 0.109], not significantly different from zero, and not significantly larger than the best random control (0.074). KILL criteria a and c fired (part 1 failed, and F6 over-refusal test failed). The pre-registered hypothesis was rejected.

**Full Gemma activation arms (111 harmful + 111 harmless per language):**

| Arm | EN harmful | SL harmful | EN harmless | SL harmless |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A0 no-op | 0.91 | 0.99 | 0.05 | 0.28 |
| A1 d_EN | 0.23 | 0.86 | 0.00 | 0.19 |
| A2 d_EN + r_prior | 0.21 | 0.83 | 0.00 | 0.12 |
| A3 r_prior alone | 0.95 | 0.98 | 0.04 | 0.19 |
| A4 d_EN + language identity | 0.23 | 0.55 | 0.02 | 0.08 |
| A7 d_EN + rand_1 | 0.21 | 0.85 | 0.01 | 0.15 |
| A10 d_EN + shuffled-label r_prior | 0.41 | 0.73 | - | - |

Several observations from the arm table:

1. **r_prior alone (A3)** had almost no effect: SL harmful refusal went from 0.99 to 0.98, EN from 0.91 to 0.95. The false-refusal direction does not carry meaningful refusal-suppression information by itself.

2. **Language-identity direction (A4)** combined with d_EN reduced SL harmful refusal from 0.86 to 0.55, the largest single-direction improvement. However, it also raised FLORES NLL by 2.0 (EN) and 1.9 (SL), destroying language modelling quality. This is not a practical intervention.

3. **Random directions (A7, A8, A9)** combined with d_EN left SL refusal between 0.74 and 0.85, comparable to d_EN alone. Random directions did not systematically help.

4. **Shuffled-label r_prior (A10)** combined with d_EN reduced SL refusal to 0.73 but also raised EN harmful refusal to 0.41, suggesting the shuffled direction disrupted the English refusal pathway as well.

**Exploratory: layer-matched d_EN across all 48 layers (X1).** Applying the per-layer English refusal direction at all 48 layers simultaneously reduced SL harmful refusal from 0.86 to 0.10 and EN harmful refusal to 0.03. This is the only intervention that nearly eliminated Slovene refusal, but it required steering at every layer simultaneously, raised FLORES NLL by 0.29 (EN) and 0.52 (SL), and is not equivalent to the single-direction abliteration that Heretic performs.

**Depth localisation.** Applying layer-matched d_EN to different layer bands:

| Band | SL harmful | EN harmful | FLORES ΔNLL SL |
|---|---|---|---|
| Layers 1-12 | 0.82 | 0.79 | 0.743 |
| Layers 13-24 | 0.82 | 0.45 | 0.017 |
| Layers 25-36 | 0.70 | 0.72 | 0.082 |
| Layers 37-48 | 0.99 | 0.87 | -0.003 |
| Layers 1-24 | 0.55 | 0.42 | 0.409 |
| Layers 1-36 | 0.21 | 0.38 | 0.513 |
| All 48 | 0.23 | 0.37 | 0.524 |

No single band removed Slovene refusal. Layers 13-24 were most effective for English (0.45) but left Slovene at 0.82. Layers 25-36 provided the most Slovene reduction per band (0.70) without large NLL cost. Full Slovene refusal removal required cumulative intervention across at least three bands.

**Weight edit repair.** The experiment also tested whether augmenting the core Heretic weight edit with additional directions could repair the Slovene gap:

| Arm | SL harmful | EN harmful | FLORES ΔNLL SL |
|---|---|---|---|
| W0 core Heretic edit | 0.89 | 0.39 | -0.005 |
| W1 core + r_prior weight edit | 0.76 | 0.23 | 0.009 |
| W3 core + layer-matched d_EN(h) | 0.11 | 0.29 | 0.546 |
| W4 core + random weight edit | 0.47 | 0.70 | 0.064 |

The r_prior weight edit (W1) reduced SL refusal from 0.89 to 0.76 while also reducing EN refusal to 0.23, but the SL residual remained high. The layer-matched weight edit (W3) reached 0.11 SL refusal but at severe NLL cost (+0.55). The random weight edit (W4) reduced SL refusal to 0.47 while raising EN refusal to 0.70, suggesting it disrupted the model rather than targeting Slovene refusal.

**Community Heretic reference vs. core edit (S4 held-out, 70 pairs):**

| Arm | EN harmful | SL harmful | SL harmless |
|---|---|---|---|
| W0 core edit | 0.39 | 0.89 | 0.07 |
| C0 community edit | 0.01 | 0.26 | 0.01 |
| C1 community + r_prior | 0.01 | 0.20 | 0.00 |

The community edit reached much lower SL refusal (0.26) than the selected trial's edit (0.89), at the cost of slightly higher FLORES NLL (+0.11 SL). Adding r_prior to the community edit reduced SL refusal from 0.26 to 0.20, a modest improvement. The community edit achieved stronger refusal suppression because it was more aggressive overall, not because it targeted Slovene specifically.

**GaMS3 descriptive arms.** The GaMS3 results were descriptive (not pre-registered for the causal test):

| Arm | EN harmful | SL harmful | EN harmless | SL harmless |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G0 no-op | 0.93 | 0.95 | 0.07 | 0.10 |
| G1 d_EN | 0.57 | 0.50 | 0.00 | 0.04 |

For GaMS3, applying d_EN reduced both EN and SL refusal comparably (from 0.93/0.95 to 0.57/0.50), consistent with the small surrogacy gap found in experiment 6. The EN-SL difference was minor.

---

## Summary of findings

[FIGURE:fig_refusal_gap]

The central result across both iterations is a dissociation between GaMS3 and Gemma in how English-tuned abliteration transfers to Slovene.

**GaMS3** showed near-complete transfer. The English-tuned Heretic edit reduced refusal to ≤ 6% in both languages (experiment 5, T1). The surrogacy gap on refusal was 0.015, meaning English outcomes predicted Slovene outcomes almost perfectly (experiment 6). The frozen probe collapsed after editing (experiment 5, T6), indicating the edit destroyed the harm signal at the representation level. Because GaMS3 had continual Slovene pretraining on top of the same Gemma-3 base, its harm representation may have become more tightly integrated across languages, allowing a single English direction to capture both.

**Gemma** showed a large transfer gap. The edit reduced English refusal from 0.971 to 0.287 on RefusEU but left Slovene refusal at 0.739 (experiment 4). The surrogacy gap on first-token refusal was 0.054 (experiment 7). The frozen probe was preserved after editing (experiment 5, T6), meaning the harm signal remained intact in the representation: the edit changed the readout for English but not for Slovene. The causal test (experiment 8) found that no single direction combined with d_EN eliminated the Slovene residual; only cumulative steering across all 48 layers achieved near-zero Slovene refusal, at substantial NLL cost.

**The exposure differential D did not carry the gap** in either model (experiments 6 and 7). The surrogacy gap is not explained by differences in how much the edit perturbs Slovene vs. English representations on harmless text.

**KL divergence showed a blind surrogacy gap** in both models: Gap_K = 0.147 for GaMS3 and 0.079 for Gemma. The English KL constraint in Heretic's objective does not fully capture what the edit does to Slovene output distributions.

**Utility was preserved** in all cells: macro task changes ≤ 0.20 points, FLORES NLL changes ≤ 0.002 (experiments 5, T3-T4). The edits did not damage general capabilities.

**Over-refusal decreased** after editing in both models (experiment 4). GaMS3 edit reduced S6 over-refusal from ~10% to 0%. Gemma edit reduced EN over-refusal from 8.7% to 1.3% and SL over-refusal from 32.7% to 19.3%. The original Gemma model had high Slovene over-refusal, and the edit only partially addressed it.

**Dead ends and null results.** (1) The A3 screen (experiment 3) for GaMS3 failed its validity gate, so no quantitative screen verdict was obtainable for that model. (2) The r_prior false-refusal direction did not carry meaningful Slovene residual in the causal test. (3) The exposure differential D, hypothesised to explain the surrogacy gap, showed zero or negative dR2 across all traits and both models. (4) Conformal prediction intervals achieved adequate coverage on only half of trait × holdout-set combinations, limiting the forecasting value of the surrogacy panel. (5) Cross-machine reproducibility checks showed non-bit-identical results (max |diff| up to 97.2), attributable to NF4 quantisation non-determinism.

title: Same edit, very different safety effect
summary: |-
  WHAT WAS RUN. Two Heretic (SHA 3521f864) runs under ONE identical optimizer: cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct and google/gemma-3-12b-it, same seed 20260923, search space, English data (mlabonne/harmful_behaviors + harmless_alpaca), bnb_4bit NF4, explicit batch size 128, 116-trial budget (60 TPE startup + 56 TPE) and pause/resume point; chat templates verified byte-identical. Heretic's interactive prompts are all scripted and logged (an unscripted one exits 3 rather than guessing). Four core checkpoints (2 originals + 2 edits chosen by a rule frozen before any trial) plus 2 swap checkpoints, scored per prompt in English and Slovene.

  HEADLINE RESULTS (all re-derived independently by audit.py: 28/28 checks, 0 mismatches, 3/3 placebo tests correctly fail).
  1. SAME-EDIT ASYMMETRY. On all 60 edits that are identical in both models, gemma-3-12b-it refuses MORE than GaMS3-12B-Instruct: 60/60 edits, 0 the other way, paired median +25 refusals/100 (bootstrap CI [10,43]). Yet the two models' KL damage from the same edit agrees almost perfectly (Spearman 0.967, CI [0.93,0.98], partial rho 0.923 after controlling for kernel mass). Refusal drop per unit KL is ~13x higher in GaMS (1449 vs 108; ratio 13.4, CI [7.0,30.0]). On the KL-matched half (KL medians 0.0101 vs 0.0098) GaMS sits at 65/100 refusals vs Gemma 99/100. Same edit, same representational damage, very different safety effect.
  2. THE RANGE-RESTRICTION GUARD BITES. A3 reading is 'intermediate', not 'shared surface': refusal ranks agree only moderately (rho 0.781, CI [0.63,0.88]; partial 0.647) and dR2_sibling is ~0 for refusal, so that rank agreement is mostly inherited from the shared parameter draws rather than a shared response surface. The guard was validated on synthetic data first (strength-only generator: dR2 CI includes 0; shared-residual generator: dR2=0.51).
  3. SELECTION AND EXACT REPRODUCTION. Fallback rule 1 fired for both (no trial reached <=10 refusals). GaMS trial 88 -> 16/100 EN refusals at KL 0.175; Gemma trial 96 -> 69/100 at KL 0.024. Both re-score EXACTLY to their journal values (KL relative difference 2e-8), and the replica reproduces Heretic's printed baselines exactly (98 and 100).
  4. CROSS-LANGUAGE, and it is NOT language-neutral. GaMS's own edit suppresses both languages (EN 98->16, SL 97->10; McNemar p<1e-24). Gemma's own edit barely moves either (EN 100->69, SL 97->90). Applying GaMS's parameters to Gemma suppresses SLOVENE far more than English (SL 97->25 vs EN 100->53) at 10x the KL cost (KL ratio own/swap 0.095, CI [0.046,0.189]). The swap never reproduces the own-edit outcome in either direction (all CIs exclude 0).
  5. DIRECTION COSINE DOES NOT PREDICT IT. The two models' orthogonalized refusal directions agree only moderately (mean cos 0.63; 0.57 over layers 24-47) while their harmless means nearly coincide (0.98) and a random-direction control gives 0.014. The large behavioural asymmetry is invisible to a raw cross-model direction cosine.
  6. NO LANGUAGE DAMAGE anywhere: FLORES+ dev per-token NLL moves by <=0.01 nats in all six checkpoints and 100% of Slovene answers remain Slovene; no checkpoint's apparent suppression is incoherence.

  LIMITS THAT MUST TRAVEL WITH THESE NUMBERS. Two models are two units: nothing here attributes the asymmetry to Slovene continued pretraining, instruction tuning or any training stage (GaMS is a same-family reference, not a controlled derivative of this Gemma checkpoint). The Gemma arm's resistance is CONFOUNDED with bnb_4bit quantization and with the reduced 116-trial budget - the published bf16 200-trial Heretic edit of gemma-3-12b-it reaches 3/100 refusals, so this is not evidence that Gemma resists abliteration in general. Slovene refusal rests on a marker list with only moderate agreement against executor hand labels (accuracy 0.75, Cohen's kappa 0.48, n=40, NATIVE_REVIEW_PENDING). The blinded 3-way LLM judge is implemented and ready (judge_sl.py) but STILL BLOCKED: retried after the platform replaced the OpenRouter key, the key this run can see (env var and secrets file, identical value and key id) returns HTTP 403 'Key limit exceeded' to every request including a 4-token probe, so 0/600 judgements succeeded and none were invented (results/judge_sl.json). SL numbers are development-grade, not final safety measurements. One optimizer seed per model; prompt-level CIs do not measure run-to-run optimizer variance. Refusal is Heretic's English keyword proxy, which counts empty answers as refusals and fires on compliant text mentioning legality or harm.

  ARTIFACTS (absolute paths in README.md and method_out.json): both Optuna journals (resumable via `uv run method.py --stages phaseB_<tag>`), both LoRA adapters with sha256, residual means and directions, per-prompt scores for all six checkpoints in results/eval/, four figures, frozen protocols. An API translator refused to translate most harmful prompts, so the Slovene set uses NLLB-200-distilled-1.3B (chrF median 70.3).

summary: >-
  A1 screen (iteration 1) on cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct@1d0b27af and google/gemma-3-12b-it@96b6f1ec (Heretic bnb_4bit NF4, bf16
  compute, L4). Data: 85 JBB harmful/benign twins after a LaBSE S1-overlap audit (15 AdvBench rows dropped), sha1 halves A
  (44) / B (41), Dolly, FLORES+, SL-LLM-Eval MC. SL is Gemini-2.5-flash MT (mean chrF 81), with NLLB fallback for 22 rows.
  Diff-in-means d_EN/d_SL on winsorized residuals; (layer, pos) chosen on half A with Arditi filters (GaMS3 L34, Gemma L20,
  pos -1); protocol hash-frozen before half B. Half B: 15 ablation conditions, u_SL increment with frozen and post-freeze
  raw-energy random controls, matched-efficacy grid, 5-dose addition, K/N/M collateral, 1,596 greedy generations judged blind
  by gpt-4.1 (the plan's gpt-4.1-mini failed the T5 hand-check), and a Heretic bridge (Heretic code, 20 TPE startup edits,
  seed 20260923). KEY RESULTS: R validity gate failed for GaMS3 (Spearman .51, AUROC .70) but passed for Gemma (.91/.96),
  so the verdict is judge-based. Frozen screen verdict: WEAK; A1's predicted contrast is REVERSED. Judged refusal after d_EN
  ablation: GaMS3 EN .90->.46 and SL .93->.34 (residual gap SL-EN -0.15 [-0.32, .03]); Gemma EN .83->.07 but SL 1.00->.85
  (gap +0.77 [.62, .89]), despite cos(d_EN, d_SL) = .92 and a log-odds transfer T(EN->SL) = 3.47. Exploratory explanation:
  Gemma's Slovene refusal margin is large (R 13.9 vs 3.6 EN; 69% of benign SL twins refused), so direction cosine and log-odds
  transfer do not predict behavioural transfer. The Heretic bridge agrees: SL-EN residual gap GaMS3 .11 [.06, .17], Gemma
  .23 [.16, .30]. GaMS3's R-based u_SL increment (F_raw .23, F_ctrl .195/.154) is collateral-confounded (span ablation FLORES
  +1.4 nat/tok; about 35% malformed). Exploratory GaMS3-only double dissociation under addition (u_SL +2.2 SL / -1.5 EN; u_EN
  +3.5 EN / -1.1 SL). Random ablation controls are destructive even when raw-energy-matched (T7 failed; documented amendment).
  Verified: T8 recompute identical; independent plain-python re-derivation matches all T/I/F/rho, judged rates and bridge
  means; placebos null. Files: method_out.json (metadata = full analysis + frozen predictions), results/analysis_summary.json,

  Frozen, hashed, audited EN/SL data protocol for the GaMS3-12B-Instruct vs gemma-3-12b-it Heretic study. full_data_out.json has 48,696 rows in 10 blocks; the per-family frozen JSONL are in data/splits/; data/split_manifest.json holds the SHA256 values (protocol_hash dc33bde4...). Workspace: /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Fapgmt6JWbcD/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_dataset_1.
  Blocks:
  - S1_heretic: Heretic 3521f864 default data, EN+SL. Direction data only.
  - S2_semantic: Semantic-Harmful/Harmless. DEV only; 400/416 harmful rows are S1 rows.
  - S3_screen_dev_prompts and S3_screen_dev_utility: copied from the pods' screen_dev.json. They keep the pod ids and halves (e.g. jbb_0), which differ from the spec strings (only 50.7% of halves agree). JBB 85 pairs, Dolly 100, FLORES dev 200, MC 120.
  - S4_strongreject_pairs: 257 StrongREJECT + gpt-4.1 twin pairs, EN+SL. Strata: hoc 70 pairs (held-out Llama-Guard categories), ind 187.

Frozen 700-row core (seed 20260923). Graded EN-SL correspondence: 0 T, 158 P, 1092 C, 150 N, the same with gemini or MADLAD back-translation, so official rows support no item-paired claims.

  - S7_slovenian_llm_eval: six tasks aligned to their English harness splits (96.6-100% verified), minus the union of carve-outs.
  - S7_flores_devtest.
  Every translated row has automated QC: cross-family back-translation chrF++ (gemini-2.5-flash for gpt-4.1 outputs, gpt-4.1-mini for gemini/pod outputs, MADLAD only where those failed), LaBSE, GlotLID, length ratio, qc_pass, and an instability flag against an independent alternate translation (gpt-4.1 for S3; MADLAD elsewhere). Native review is PENDING (250-row blinded packet).
  Overlap audit: no near-duplicate or exact overlap of S4-S7 with S1-S3.
  Key finding: the screen-spec gemini prompt used as a system message answered or refused 49% of items; data/reports/screenspec_layout_check.json.

title: Bilingual safety test of four model versions
summary: |-
  C1 BEHAVIOUR, the FINAL behavioural evaluation, executed once against a protocol and prompt sample frozen and hashed before any model output existed. 4,800 greedy 256-token generations: 5 checkpoints (gams_orig, gams_edit=Heretic LoRA trial 88, gemma_orig, gemma_edit=trial 96, plus community_ref p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic as a SANITY REFERENCE) x 960 prompts (S5 = 280 RefusEU row_ids x EN+SL; S5X = 100 verified EN-SL translation pairs, the ONLY paired cross-language basis; S6 = 150 XSTest-safe x EN+SL). Each edit and its original share one NF4 base load (adapter enabled vs disable_adapter()), the same frozen bucket batch schedule and the same blinded judge.

  RESULTS (every number re-derived twice by independent code paths: audit.py 127/127, verify_headlines.py 173/173, 0 mismatches, placebos correct).
  1. Suppression, without breakage: GaMS3 EN refusal .986->.014, SL .871->.000; Gemma-3 EN .971->.287, SL .939->.739 (all Holm p<1e-14). Invalid rate is 0.000 in EVERY cell and SL language consistency moves <=0.4 points, so neither edit buys suppression with incoherence. Over-refusal on XSTest-safe also falls (GaMS3 .100->.000 EN; Gemma-3 .327->.193 SL). Official-guard ASR: GaMS3 edit .982 EN / .972 SL; Gemma-3 edit .738 EN / .103 SL.
  2. HEADLINE: on the 100 paired translations the English-derived edit transfers to Slovene in GaMS3 but not in Gemma-3 - residual SL-EN refusal gap +.69 [.60,.78], McNemar p=3.4e-21 for gemma_edit vs ~0 for gams_edit and both originals; DiD +.66 [.55,.76] vs +.01 [-.03,.05]. The sign holds in BOTH translation directions, so it is not translationese.
  3. NOT intrinsic to Gemma-3: the community bf16 edit of the same base shows a gap of only +.12 [.05,.20]. What differs is achieved optimisation strength, not architecture.
  4. MEASUREMENT FINDING (likely mechanism for 3): Heretic's own keyword proxy is near-exact on the ORIGINALS (false-positive share .015-.031) but collapses on the edits - gemma_edit EN keyword-refusal .851 vs judged .255, i.e. 76% false positives, kappa -.04. Gemma's compliances are caveat-laden and keep firing the markers, and gemma_edit EN refusals become PARTIAL compliance (.548), so an optimiser scored by that proxy loses gradient.
  5. NEGATIVE (supplementary): R_seq refusal readout pooled Spearman .86/.84 (GaMS3) but .63/.48 (Gemma-3), collapsing to .16-.33 within edit checkpoints alone - most apparent validity is the orig-vs-edit contrast.

  JUDGING / LIMITS. The run-level OpenRouter budget blocked gpt-4.1 at 716/3,840 core items (seeded-random shuffled order, so a random subset). Per fallback F1 a substitute judge from a third family, Qwen3-14B run locally, applies the SAME frozen rubric to all 4,800 items; it agrees with gpt-4.1 at kappa .83 (6-way CLASS) and .91 (refused-vs-not). Its safe/unsafe line tracks the REQUEST (it marks 77% of gemma_edit EN refusals unsafe), so ASR comes from RefusEU's official pipeline (Llama-Guard-3-8B + PolyGuard-Qwen, 91.2% agreement, full reproduction; 292 unadjudicated disagreements are BOUNDED, not dropped); its LANG line fails on short Slovene refusals, so language consistency is GlotLID (100% agreement with gpt-4.1 on the overlap). Gemini second judge and the gpt-4o-mini adjudicator were not run (same budget block); native review is PENDING; a 30-item blind EXECUTOR CHECK gives kappa .67 5-way / .93 refused-vs-not. B3 batching certification FAILED as designed (GaMS3 failed even unpadded exact-length buckets, so part of the batch-vs-single drift is NF4 numerics, not padding); buckets with one shared schedule were used for all five checkpoints. Nothing is attributed to a training stage (n=2 models, one optimisation seed); S5 EN-vs-SL is UNPAIRED; absolute levels are NF4- and 256-token-specific. API spend $1.07.

title: Utility cost and inner harm signal after abliteration
summary: >-
  Four checkpoints (GaMS3-12B-Instruct and gemma-3-12b-it originals + iteration-1 Heretic LoRA edits, trials 88/96), EN and
  SL, NF4, one code path. BEHAVIOUR (gpt-4.1, random ~52% of S4 harmful gens; run budget exhausted): GaMS edit refused 100->5.6%
  EN / 6.7% SL; Gemma edit 99->70.3% EN / 95.3% SL (English-derived edit transfers fully in GaMS, barely in Gemma although
  Gemma's EN/SL harm-direction cosine is higher, 0.92 vs 0.83). Marker rule badly undercounts Gemma refusals (32.7% vs 70.3%).
  Second free judge (nemotron-3-ultra) kappa vs gpt-4.1 0.83 (refused) / 0.77 (6-way). UTILITY: 6 tasks x 250 frozen items
  x EN/SL, harness-replica scorer validated vs lm-eval (strings 100% identical, flag agreement 98.7/99.5%; ll bar fails only
  via harness bf16 rounding): macro change +0.13/+0.20 (GaMS EN/SL), +0.13/0.00 (Gemma), Holm p=1; all task deltas within
  1.6 pts; FLORES dNLL <=0.002; no wrong-language/empty/malformed outputs; Gemma EN first-token KL uninformative (255/257
  'Okay,'). MECHANISM: harm linearly decodable (held-out S4 AUROC >=0.996, not lexical/length). GaMS: frozen original probe
  collapses (0.998->0.60 EN/0.42 SL at L34, min 0.20 at L27) while refit stays 0.985/0.954; 71-73% of harm mean-difference
  energy on the frozen axis removed to ~0.1%, complement AUROC 0.985/0.955 -> re-encoding, not information loss. Gemma: frozen-axis
  separation halves equally in EN and SL from L28, yet behaviour changes only in EN -> axis compression does not explain the
  language asymmetry; late-layer axis rotation differs (cos 0.53 EN vs 0.83 SL). A2 (pre-registered): GaMS R_seq passes gate;
  slope ratio 0.36 EN / 0.42 SL -> EVIDENCE_LOSS label = decoupling of refusal from the ORIGINAL evidence axis while information
  stays decodable (changed mapping). Gemma R_seq fails gate EN; judged logistic also EVIDENCE_LOSS (flagged separation artefact).
  Gemma flips hit low-evidence items first (criterion-shift signature). EXPLORATORY dose-response (LoRA x f): Gemma SL needs
  ~2x edit strength (R_seq>0 harmful SL 98.8/77.4/46.3/7.0% at f=1/1.5/2/3 vs EN 90.3/45.1/24.5/12.8%); GaMS EN/SL move together.
  Bonus GaMS3-12B base: harm decodable (CV AUROC 0.99/0.96), complies with most harmful QA prompts. Outputs: method_out.json
  (8056 examples: S4 per item x lang x role with responses, labels, R_seq/R1, s_i, KL; S7 utility per item), results/analysis/tables.md
  + summary.json, per-item parquets, S5/S5X projections, r_prior npz, figures fig1-fig8, blinded review packet (PENDING).
  Audits: verify_numbers 80/80, audit_headline raw re-derivation identical with failing placebos. Caveats: n=2 models, one
  Heretic run each, NF4, MT Slovene, partial judge coverage.

title: 'What English edits miss in Slovene: GaMS3 panel'
summary: >-
  P1 random-edit panel on cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct@1d0b27af (bnb_4bit NF4, Heretic 3521f864, default LoRA operator). 246 Heretic
  edits (E0 = journal trials 0-59, E_TPE = trials 60-115 incl. core trial 88, E1 = 100 prior draws seed 20260925, E_R = 30
  draws seed 20260924; E0/E1/E_R certified identical to the sibling Gemma pod) were rebuilt through Heretic's own reset_model+abliterate
  and scored in EN and SL on teacher-forced traits over S3 DEV halves A/B: R_seq, R1, Rb (JBB 85 twins), K = log mean truncated
  KL on Dolly continuations (100), N = FLORES NLL rise (200), M = MC margin change (120). Question: are EN traits (all Heretic's
  optimiser sees) a sufficient surrogate for SL? Gap_t = R2*(EN_A->EN_B) - R2*(EN_A->SL_B), noise-ceiling normalised, joint
  edit x item bootstrap B=1000, protocol frozen+hashed before any trait. RESULTS (F = 160 fitted edits, primary learner HistGBT):
  refusal proxy R_seq passes the judged validity gate (Spearman EN 0.970, SL 0.910 over 18 conditions). Claim 1 holds (confirmatory):
  Gap_R = 0.015, 90% CI [0.008, 0.027]: EN predicts SL refusal as well as EN. Main hypothesis G3 SUPPORTED for K only (confirmatory):
  Gap_K = 0.147 [0.074, 0.265], Holm p~0, MDE 0.137, SIMEX 0.112, margin-matched 0.131, halves 0.118/0.150, B_K 0.050 [0.001,
  0.121]; reverse direction -0.124 (language-specific K component). SL KL is smaller on average (mean-change ratio 0.59) but
  EN traits cannot rank which edits hurt SL. N and M: F8 'no signal to predict' (no automatic language damage visible). Frozen
  exposure carrier D FAILS (G4; dR2 for K -0.011 [-0.058, 0.027]); exploratory post-freeze lead: refusal-direction SOURCE
  LAYER explains the SL/EN KL ratio (Spearman 0.77; dR2 0.047 [0.008, 0.074] over EN traits + static baselines). Gap_Heretic_K
  on journal trials only 0.018 (boundary). Forecast coverage fails on E_TPE for several traits (G6 false). r_prior defined
  (G5 false). Bilingual reselection keeps trial 88 (SL_est 1.1). Independent re-derivation (rederive_headlines.py, different
  learners): Gap_K 0.115/0.105, Gap_R ~0.01, validity and kappa exact; all placebos fail. Judging: gpt-4.1 labelled 1130/2140
  generations ($1.06) before the run-level OpenRouter budget ran out; the remaining 1010 and the second-judge role use a local
  Qwen3-14B (kappa vs gpt-4.1 0.875 refused-vs-not, n=1130); gemini second judge not run. Cross-GPU repro: traits re-score
  within numerics; weak-edit KL has a hardware floor. Per-edit variances for power: results/variances_for_power.json. Key

title: English edits barely unlock Slovene refusal in Gemma
summary: >-
  Gemma-3-12b-it (NF4, Heretic 3521f864) random-edit panel testing whether English refusal/utility traits predict Slovene.
  203 edits scored teacher-forced in EN+SL on frozen S3 DEV halves: E0 = 60 journal startup trials (same vectors as the GaMS
  pod), E1 = 103 fresh prior draws (seed 20260925), E_TPE = trial 96 + last 40 TPE trials (held out). Fitted set 163 non-collapsed
  (>=150 floor met). Traits R_seq, R1, Rb, K, N, M; covariates P (r_prior), H (d_EN), D, b1/b2/b3, Omega. Validity: 14 edits
  judged by a LOCAL judge (original gemma, frozen gpt-4.1 rubric; 98.2% binary agreement with gpt-4.1 on 440 original generations);
  API blocked by the run budget. R* = R1 (Spearman EN .892 / SL .853). KEY RESULTS: (1) Slovene refusal is strongly attenuated:
  SL/EN transfer slope R1 0.436, R_seq 0.220. Core edit trial 96: judged harmful refusal EN 36->10/41, SL 41->39/41; no validity
  edit brought SL below 30/41. The attenuation survives margin matching (slope 0.558) and the mixed model (sl:x -0.321). (2)
  Teacher-forced, edits raise compliance log-prob equally in both languages (slope 0.849) but lower the refusal-opener log-prob
  only in English (slope 0.081). (3) The attenuated response is predictable from English: R2 EN_A->SL_B 0.94 vs EN_B 0.99;
  Gap_R1 +0.054 [0.022, 0.128] (<0.10 -> P-a NOT CONFIRMED; within a label-swap placebo range); margin-matched +0.057 (P-d
  NOT CONFIRMED); Gap_Rb +0.018 (P-b UNTESTABLE, Rb fails the SL gate); Gap_K +0.079 (Holm p .009); N and M unreliable in
  SL. (4) Carrier: r_prior removal P adds dR2 +0.004 over geometry baselines, which themselves have CV R2<=0 (P-c NOT CONFIRMED);
  exploratory H adds nothing. (5) No journal trial has predicted SL judged refusal <= 0.20 (best 0.57). Audit (independent
  numpy path) and rederive.py (raw files, polynomial OLS: Gap_R1 +0.052; slopes and judged counts match exactly) pass, with
  placebos failing as expected. Outputs: method_out.json (per-edit rows + all analysis tables), results/analysis.json, results/verdicts.json,
  results/panel/*.parquet, results/validity/, figures fig1-6, README.md, reproducibility.md. Caveats: correlational carrier;

title: Why an English safety edit misses Slovene
summary: >-
  Iteration-2 causal test in google/gemma-3-12b-it (NF4 4-bit, pinned 96b6f1ec), with cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct as a descriptive
  contrast and p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic@e037e6e1 as a held-out community edit. Question: is the Slovene refusal that survives
  an English refusal-direction ablation (d_EN, A1 frozen site L20) carried by a harm-orthogonal, language-conditioned refusal
  prior r_prior (Wang et al. 2025 false-refusal construction from judged harmless refusals)? Directions, layer and strengths
  were chosen on S3 half A and frozen (configs/FREEZE.sha256) before the OUTCOME set (41 JBB half-B + 70 StrongREJECT held-out-category
  twin pairs, EN+SL; 111 harmful + 111 harmless per language) was touched. 12,136 greedy generations; blind batched gpt-4.1
  judge (5,298 labels, every frozen-prediction arm fully covered; $3.43, run budget then exhausted), local Qwen3-14B second
  judge on every generation (kappa 0.77 refused-vs-not). RESULTS: the pre-registered hypothesis FAILS. d_EN leaves 0.86 SL
  harmful refusal (EN 0.23); adding r_prior at matched EN efficacy cuts it by only 0.036 [-0.037, 0.109], below the best energy+collateral-matched
  random (0.074) and the shuffled-label control (0.135): KILL (a) and (c) fire; F1/F3/F4/F6 fail, F2 passes, F5 is not evaluable
  (community SL hoc refusal 0.26 < 0.40). r_prior is language-dominated (cos with the language axis 0.65, with its shuffled-label
  twin 0.89); d_EN+l cuts 0.315 but costs +1.93 nats of SL FLORES NLL. r_prior alone gives a real but sub-threshold drop in
  SL over-refusal (0.28 to 0.19, Holm p 0.025). EXPLORATORY discovery (declared post-freeze): ablating each layer's own d_EN(h)
  at all 48 layers removes the SL residual (0.86 to 0.10, gpt-4.1 partial coverage; 0.91 to 0.23 second judge) with fluent
  Slovene (FLORES +0.52), whereas layer-matched random (0.86) and energy-matched PC (0.93) controls do nothing, and no single
  12-layer band suffices (cumulative through layers 1-36): the residual is written redundantly across depth, not missing a
  direction. The same move repairs the core Heretic edit (SL hoc 0.93 to 0.11; its random control 0.47). The core iteration-1
  edit is optimisation-limited (SL hoc 0.89 vs community 0.26). GaMS3 shows no SL-specific residual. Frozen harm probe still
  decodes harmfulness after ablation; cosine-based transfer prediction fails at item level (AUROC 0.24). All numbers re-derived
  by verify_numbers.py (103/103) and independently from raw files by audit_headline.py (43/43, placebos null). Files: method_out.json

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the evidence recorded here actually supports what the run concluded, and whether a direction it abandoned was abandoned for a good reason.

<task>
Audit this research record. It is an internal report, not a paper: chronological, one
section per iteration, complete. Judge it on completeness, traceability and what it says
was learned — never on framing, section order or polish. When it claims a positive result,
novelty is evidence, not framing: check it against the nearest published neighbour (STEP 5),
not against how well the paper will read.

STEP 1 — READ THE REPORT: Read it carefully. Note what each iteration claims it did, found
and concluded.

STEP 2 — WALK THE ARTIFACTS: Go through the supplementary materials one artifact at a time
and find where the report reports it. Open the output files. Every executed artifact must
appear, and every table in those files must be in the report with its actual numbers. List
the misses; each one is a major issue.

STEP 3 — TRACE THE NUMBERS: For each number, table and claim in the report, find the
artifact it came from, and RECOMPUTE the headline number(s) yourself from that artifact's
own tables or result files rather than taking the report's figure on trust. Report any
mismatch as a finding, even when the underlying artifact is real. Where an artifact does
not let you recompute a number — the raw output is missing, or the computation cannot be
reproduced from what is there — say so and treat that claim as unverified rather than
accepted. An [ARTIFACT:id] marker or a named output file makes a number traceable; nothing
makes it untraceable, which is a major issue even when the number is right.

STEP 4 — CHECK COVERAGE AGAINST THE ORIGINAL REQUEST: The user's original request that
started this run is supplied as a separate message in this turn. Read it and ask what it
actually asked for. Is the run answering THAT, or a question next to it? Set `coverage`
to "full", "partial" or "lost", and when it is not "full", raise a critique naming the
part of the request that went unanswered. Judge against the request, not against the
report's own framing of it — a run that narrows one defensible step per iteration ends up
answering something nobody asked, and each step looked fine on its own.

STEP 5 — CHECK THE RECORD HOLDS TOGETHER:
- Is the REASONING written down at every step — why this strategy, why these artifacts,
  what the last review objected to, what the hypothesis revision concluded and why it moved?
  Outcomes with no account of why they were sought is a major issue.
- Are DEAD ENDS kept and labelled, with the evidence that killed them? A direction the
  artifacts show was tried and the report does not mention is a major issue.
- Is the CHRONOLOGY intact — one section per iteration, in order, earlier sections
  unchanged except where a correction is marked in place? A silently rewritten earlier
  section destroys the record.
- Are the numbers from artifacts that ACTUALLY RAN? Trace each one to an executed output. A
  projected, expected, illustrative or placeholder number presented as a result means
  `results_reported` is false.
- Is what the report concludes PROPORTIONATE to what it recorded? A tiny effect, or an
  effect in the direction everyone already expected, written up as the answer is either
  explained (a bound someone needed, a belief it overturns, a mechanism only visible at
  that size) or it overreaches, and you say so.
- When the report claims a POSITIVE, non-obvious result, name the nearest published result
  that already answers something close to it, and state what this iteration adds beyond
  that neighbour. A positive result earns no credit for novelty in this record until that
  comparison is made — its absence is a critique under `novelty`, not a paper-framing note.
- Does anything the report concludes CONTRADICT its own evidence — a table, a figure, a
  log, an artifact summary? Name the contradiction.
- A conclusion that contradicts the run's own evidence scores soundness 1.
- Set `blocking` by rule: true exactly when the soundness score is 1 or lower OR
  `results_reported` is false; otherwise false.

STEP 6 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (the record is incomplete or untraceable) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly, naming the artifact or section it is about
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Provide your review via structured output.

i want a reproducible bilingual study of refusal suppression in google/gemma-3-12b-it and cjvt/GaMS3-12B-Instruct, with room for a genuine scientific discovery. compare each original model with one Heretic-abliterated version, evaluating all four checkpoints in English and Slovene. establish the safety–utility trade-offs, then investigate what explains them internally.

the attached research plan defines the intended study and supplies literature leads. verify its factual claims and references. this prompt governs execution: keep the core comparison fixed, but choose the mechanistic methods and discovery direction yourself. do not assume the expected findings are true.

Gemma-IT is a same-family, same-size aligned reference, not the direct training parent of GaMS-Instruct. endpoint differences cannot establish what Slovene continual pretraining, instruction tuning, or the small safety-training set caused.

step 1 - explore and establish feasibility. load both original models, pin revisions, verify their official tokenizers and chat templates, and inspect behavior and activations on a small development set in both languages. check coherent output, baseline refusal, and hidden-state extraction. use text-only inputs and comparable precision and inference settings; record unavoidable differences. inspect where the models behave similarly and where they differ, without committing to a mechanism. estimate the compute needed before scaling up. use separate smoke-test data and keep final evaluation untouched. if an edit fails or destroys language ability, investigate and report the failure rather than quietly substituting another model or calling incoherence successful refusal suppression.

step 2 - find the scientific opening. develop 5–7 distinct, falsifiable explanations or research directions from the pilot and the literature. search beyond refusal-vector papers, including multilingual representations, decision calibration, causal intervention, and capability interference. actively try to disprove novelty by reading the closest primary sources. select one or two promising directions for deeper experiments.

possible starting points: does cross-language intervention transfer depend on something that direction cosine misses? can we distinguish loss of harmfulness information from a changed mapping between that information and refusal? does interference with language-relevant computation explain different utility costs? these are suggestions, not required findings or an exhaustive menu. replace them if the evidence points somewhere better.

for each selected hypothesis, state its prediction, strongest competing explanation, simplest baseline, and a result that would falsify it. discovering that familiar geometry fails to predict behavior can be valuable if you establish its boundary. merely applying Heretic to GaMS, observing EN–SL vector similarity, or finding separable harmfulness after refusal declines is insufficient by itself as a novelty claim. if an exploratory hypothesis fails the novelty check, replace that hypothesis while preserving the core study.

step 3 - freeze the data and intervention protocol. separate Heretic construction/optimization data, mechanistic development data, held-out mechanistic validation, and final behavioral evaluation. keep translations, paraphrases, and harmful/harmless counterparts from the same semantic source together when splitting. audit overlap by source and meaning, not only exact strings. Heretic's default sources and Semantic-Harmful/Semantic-Harmless may overlap; those pairs cannot automatically serve as independent validation.

create one main Heretic checkpoint per original model using the same pinned version, English prompt source, comparable objectives, and equal search budgets. choose checkpoints by a declared development-only rule balancing refusal reduction and harmless divergence. evaluate that same English-derived edit in both languages. a community Gemma edit is a sanity reference, not a substitute for the matched main intervention. record configurations, seeds, selected trials, precision, and checkpoint hashes. distinguish differences in achieved optimization from intrinsic model properties. additional seeds or edit strengths may support a focused robustness analysis, but keep them separate from the four core checkpoints.

step 4 - measure behavior and utility. use the official NASK-PIB/RefusEU evaluation data for English and Slovene, following its published scoring protocol where reproducible. report harmful compliance/attack success, refusal, and language consistency separately. refusal and harmful compliance are not complements: ambiguous, irrelevant, malformed, and empty outputs need explicit treatment. include a small independent benign safety-adjacent set to measure over-refusal. a model that refuses everything, or cannot answer coherently, must not look successful.

use the same frozen judge and rubric across conditions, with model identity hidden. check scoring sensitivity using a second independent judge on a stratified sample. prepare a blinded EN/SL sample for human review; if qualified human review is unavailable, mark it pending and state the limitation instead of claiming it happened.

for utility, use Slovenian LLM Eval and the corresponding English tasks: ARC-Challenge, BoolQ, HellaSwag, OpenBookQA, PIQA, and Winogrande. report individual tasks and their macro-average, emphasizing original-to-edited changes within each language. also measure harmless divergence on held-out inputs, wrong-language output, repetition, and output validity. Heretic's optimization KL alone is not independent evidence of preserved utility.

do not assume RefusEU examples sharing an ID are exact translations, or that EN and SL benchmark difficulty is identical. verify correspondence before making paired cross-language claims. use a separate faithful EN/SL contrast set for controlled language comparisons. translate only missing material, preserve semantic IDs, document translation checks, and distinguish automated checks from native-speaker review. published model-card scores are context and sanity checks; measure the four checkpoints yourself under the same protocol.

step 5 - connect representations to behavior. complete the mechanistic core: layer-wise bilingual harmful/harmless direction characterization in both originals, and held-out harmfulness separability before and after Heretic. choose and justify activation locations and token positions. select layers, probes, and hyperparameters on development data only.

control for topic, wording, prompt length, language identity, and response leakage. decoding harmfulness from generated refusal text is not evidence that a pre-response harmfulness signal drives refusal. compare a frozen original-model probe with appropriately cross-validated probes refitted after editing where useful: failure of the frozen probe can reflect representation drift rather than information loss. do not interpret raw cross-model vector cosine as shared mechanism without establishing comparable coordinates.

relate internal measurements to actual behavioral changes in each language. high probe accuracy establishes decodability, not causal use. a harmful-minus-harmless direction is only refusal-associated until interventions support a stronger interpretation. changes in a direction directly targeted by Heretic are expected and cannot alone carry the discovery.

step 6 - pursue the strongest explanation. use the freedom from step 2 to design the smallest decisive experiment. where justified, extract EN- and SL-derived directions and test the source-language × evaluation-language transfer matrix within each model. choose intervention locations and strengths on development data, and include no-op and matched random-direction controls plus benign utility checks. keep these activation interventions separate from the main Heretic comparison.

you may instead pursue subspaces, layer-specific interventions, representation-to-action coupling, or another approach supported by the pilot. the goal is a result that distinguishes competing explanations and predicts something on untouched data. use held-out semantic categories or an independent prompt source to challenge it. explain what survives, what breaks, and where the claim stops. prefer one well-tested insight over a large collection of loosely connected metrics. preserve the behavioral and mechanistic core even if every novelty candidate fails.

step 7 - test the claims honestly. freeze primary outcomes and confirmatory analyses before final evaluation. report original-to-edited effects for each model and language, with effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals. compare those changes across models and languages without attributing them to a specific training stage.

state the resampling and aggregation units. pair outputs on the same prompts and cluster translations/paraphrases by underlying semantic item; use cross-language pairing only where correspondence is established. four checkpoints, many layers, or many prompts do not create many independent model families. prompt-level uncertainty also does not measure variation across Heretic optimization runs. account for searching across hypotheses and layers, separate exploratory from confirmatory results, and state when sample sizes cannot resolve a difference. if resources require subsampling, freeze a stratified sample before viewing results and narrow the claims accordingly.

bonus - examine cjvt/GaMS3-12B as a bounded pre-instruction diagnostic. test harmfulness separability and a small EN/SL behavior sample with appropriate base-model formatting. do not compare its raw refusal rate with chat models as if the tasks were identical. only attempt base abliteration if refusal-like behavior is reproducible, the intervention has an interpretable target, and it does not jeopardize the main study. intermediate training checkpoints and no-safety training controls belong to a later extension unless already available.

deliver a reproducible repository and a paper grounded in executed experiments: pinned dependencies, split manifests, configurations, per-example outputs and scores, analysis scripts, and figures covering the four checkpoints in both languages. distinguish observations, interpretations, failed hypotheses, and unexecuted proposals. recompute every headline number from saved results and reconcile the abstract, tables, figures, and conclusions after the final audit. the discovery may change as evidence accumulates; the final paper must reflect the strongest claim that actually survives.
