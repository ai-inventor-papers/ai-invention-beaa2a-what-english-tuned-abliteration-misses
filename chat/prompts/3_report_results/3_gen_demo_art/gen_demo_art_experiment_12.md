description: "Pins Google Colab's runtime for generated Jupyter notebooks — Python 3.12, the exact pre-installed versions of numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, torch, transformers and more, and the install cell guarded on google.colab that installs those versions locally but never on Colab, where reinstalling them corrupts already-loaded C extensions. ALWAYS read before writing, editing or testing any .ipynb meant to run on Colab. Triggers: Colab, notebook, ipynb, google.colab, /content, numpy.dtype size changed, ABI mismatch, np.alltrue removed in NumPy 2.0, pip install inside a notebook, nbconvert execute, Colab RAM tiers and session timeouts. NOT for plain Python scripts and repo code (aii-python), for measuring or budgeting local hardware (aii-use-hardware), or for renting cloud GPUs (aii-runpod)."

## Colab Runtime (as of 2026-02)

- **Python**: 3.12.12
- **OS**: Linux 6.6.105+ x86_64, glibc 2.35

## Critical Rule: Do NOT pip install pre-installed packages ON COLAB

Colab's core scientific packages have **compiled C extensions** linked against each other at specific ABI versions. Installing ANY different version (even a minor bump) partially overwrites files while the loaded `.so` extensions stay in memory, causing:

- `ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed` (numpy 1.x vs 2.x ABI)
- `ImportError: cannot import name '_center'` (numpy 2.0 vs 2.2 ABI)
- Silent corruption of scipy/sklearn/pandas internals

**On Colab: do NOT install these packages. Use Colab's versions.**
**Locally: MUST install these packages at Colab's exact versions** to match the Colab environment.

## Pre-installed Core Packages

These are pre-installed on Colab. On Colab: skip them. Locally: install at these exact versions.

## Install Cell Pattern

The install cell must work on BOTH Colab and local Jupyter. Use this conditional pattern:

```python
import subprocess, sys
def _pip(*a): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', *a])

# Packages NOT pre-installed on Colab (always install everywhere)
_pip('some-rare-pkg==1.2.3')

# Core packages (pre-installed on Colab, install locally to match Colab env)
if 'google.colab' not in sys.modules:
    _pip('numpy==2.0.2', 'pandas==2.2.2', 'scikit-learn==1.6.1', 'scipy==1.16.3', 'matplotlib==3.10.0')
```

**How this works:**
- On **Colab**: `google.colab` is in `sys.modules` → skips core packages (uses Colab's pre-installed ones) → only installs non-Colab packages
- **Locally**: `google.colab` is NOT in `sys.modules` → installs core packages at Colab's exact versions → local .venv matches Colab's environment as closely as possible

Rules:
- CRITICAL: On Colab, pip installing ANY version of numpy/pandas/sklearn/scipy/matplotlib (even the same version) CORRUPTS the pre-loaded C extensions. These MUST be behind the `google.colab` guard.
- Check the pre-installed package list above. If a package is on that list, put it in the `google.colab` guard block. If not, install it unconditionally.
- For the local (non-Colab) install, use the EXACT versions from the list above so the local environment matches Colab.
- Do NOT use `--force-reinstall` — corrupts Colab system packages.
- Do NOT use `%pip` or `!pip` — use the `_pip()` helper for proper conditional control.
- `%%capture` hides install noise — only add AFTER testing is done.
- If a package requires a newer numpy/scipy than Colab has, that package is INCOMPATIBLE with Colab — find an older version or alternative.

### Example

Code imports: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `imodels`, `dit`, `rich`

```python
import subprocess, sys
def _pip(*a): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', *a])

# imodels, dit — NOT on Colab, always install
_pip('imodels==2.0.4')
_pip('--no-deps', 'dit==1.5')

# numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, rich — pre-installed on Colab, install locally only
if 'google.colab' not in sys.modules:
    _pip('numpy==2.0.2', 'pandas==2.2.2', 'scikit-learn==1.6.1', 'matplotlib==3.10.0', 'rich==13.9.4')
```

### Checking if a package is pre-installed

Before adding a package to the install cell, check:
1. Is it in the pre-installed list above?
2. If unsure, skip it — Colab has 500+ packages pre-installed. If the import works without installing, it's pre-installed.

## NumPy 2.0 Compatibility for Non-Colab Packages

Colab has **numpy 2.0.2**. NumPy 2.0 removed several long-deprecated APIs that older packages still use. If a non-Colab package was written for numpy 1.x, it may crash at runtime with errors like:

- `AttributeError: np.alltrue was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`
- `AttributeError: np.sometrue was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`
- `AttributeError: np.product was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`

**Fix**: Add a compat shim in the imports cell (BEFORE importing the affected package):

```python
import numpy as np
if not hasattr(np, "alltrue"): np.alltrue = np.all
if not hasattr(np, "sometrue"): np.sometrue = np.any
if not hasattr(np, "product"): np.product = np.prod
```

**When to add this**: After installing non-Colab packages, test-run the notebook. If you get `AttributeError: np.X was removed`, add the corresponding shim. Common offenders: `dit`, older scientific libraries that haven't been updated for numpy 2.0.

## Colab-Specific Gotchas

1. **No kernel restart after pip install** — Unlike local Jupyter, Colab doesn't cleanly reload C extensions after pip install. Once numpy/scipy/sklearn are loaded, their C code stays in memory forever until full runtime reset.

2. **`%pip` vs `_pip()` helper** — In notebook install cells, use the `_pip()` helper (see pattern above) so you can wrap installs in Python `if` conditionals. `%pip` and `!pip` can't be used inside if/else blocks.

3. **File system** — `/content/` is the working directory. Files persist within a session but are lost on runtime disconnect.

4. **Memory** — Free tier: ~12GB RAM. Pro: ~25-50GB. Monitor with `!free -h`.

5. **Timeouts** — Free tier disconnects after ~90 min idle, ~12 hours max session. Pro: longer.

6. **`%%capture`** — Suppresses all cell output including errors. Only use on install cells AFTER verifying they work. During development, leave install output visible.

## Testing Notebooks Locally (Simulating Colab)

The goal: create a clean Python 3.12 .venv that mirrors Colab's environment, then run the notebook in it.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```

**What happens when the notebook runs in this .venv:**
1. The .venv starts empty (just jupyter + ipykernel)
2. The install cell runs → `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules
3. Non-Colab packages get installed unconditionally
4. Core packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) get installed at Colab's exact versions via the `google.colab` guard
5. Result: the .venv now has the same packages as Colab + the extra non-Colab packages = as close to Colab as possible

This ensures the notebook works from scratch with an environment matching Colab. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.

name: aii-long-running-tasks
description: "Scales an experiment or evaluation up in stages — mini, 10, 50, 100, 200, then the largest run that fits — recording runtime at each step and extrapolating time-per-example against the remaining time budget before growing further, with background execution and hard RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_CPU caps. ALWAYS read before launching any script expected to run for many minutes or hours over a dataset. Triggers: long-running job, overnight or unattended run, time budget, how many examples fit, extrapolate runtime, start small then scale up, run in background and poll, avoid a timeout, full-dataset evaluation, resource limits. NOT for choosing the concurrency mechanism itself (aii-parallel-computing), measuring the machine's CPU, RAM or GPU (aii-use-hardware), or provisioning cloud pods (aii-runpod)."
---

## Core Principles

1. **Time budget first**: Read your time/runtime constraints before running anything. Set every Bash timeout to fit within the budget.
2. **Start small, scale up**: Run on minimal input first, fix errors, then increase scale.
3. **Extrapolate before scaling**: Use recorded runtimes to predict whether the next step fits in the budget. Don't guess — calculate.
4. **Background execution**: For anything that takes >1 min, run in background (`run_in_background=true`) and do useful work while waiting.
5. **Stop early if needed**: Quality results on less data beats a timeout or crash. It's always acceptable to stop at a smaller scale.

---

## Gradual Scaling Sequence

Run code at increasing data sizes, checking runtime at each step.

Substitute your actual file names:
- `{mini_file}` — mini JSON (3 examples) from dependency workspace
- `{full_file}` — full dataset from dependency workspace
- `{script}` — your processing script (e.g., `./method.py`, `./eval.py`)
- `{schema}` — JSON schema to validate output against

**STEP 1 — MINI DATA:** Run `{script}` on `{mini_file}`. Do NOT truncate logs. Fix all errors. Validate output against `{schema}`. Verify you are NOT using mock scripts, mock data, or mock APIs.

**STEP 2 — 10 EXAMPLES:** Modify `{script}` to load only the first 10 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Validate schema. Record the runtime.

**STEP 3 — 50 EXAMPLES:** Load first 50 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. **EXTRAPOLATE**: Using runtimes from steps 2-3, estimate time per example. Calculate how many examples fit in your remaining time budget. If 50 already used most of the budget, stop here.

**STEP 4 — 100 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 100 examples. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. Re-extrapolate with the new data point.

**STEP 5 — 200 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 200 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime.

**STEP 6 — MAXIMIZE:** Using all recorded runtimes, extrapolate time-per-example (it may not be perfectly linear — account for overhead). Calculate the maximum number of examples that fits within your remaining time budget with a 10% safety margin. Load that many (or all if they fit). Run and validate.

## Final Testing Phase

After completing the scaling sequence, redo the entire sequence **one more time** up to your final example count:

mini → 10 → 50 → 100 → 200 → max

At each scale: look for issues, fix problems, validate output, ensure it completes within time limits.

---

## Background Execution

For any step that takes >1 min, run as a **background task**:

1. Launch with Bash `run_in_background=true`
2. While it runs, use the time productively:
   - Sanity-check previous outputs
   - Verify file integrity (correct field names, non-empty values)
   - Review code for edge cases at larger scale
   - Prepare the next step
3. Check back on the background task to get results
4. If it failed, fix errors and re-run

---

## Resource Limits

Set hard RAM and CPU time limits so code fails fast instead of crashing the system. Read limits from `<hardware>` and leave headroom for the OS (e.g., if 16GB total, cap at 14GB).

Python example using stdlib `resource` module:
```python
import resource
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (14 * 1024**3, 14 * 1024**3))  # 14GB RAM
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (3600, 3600))  # 1 hour CPU time
```
Exceeding RAM raises `MemoryError`. Exceeding CPU time sends `SIGKILL`.

## Monitoring

At each step, record runtime AND check resource usage (`free -h` for RAM, `top -bn1 | head -5` for CPU). If memory usage is climbing toward the limit or CPU is pegged, stop and investigate before scaling further.
